I got my ipad in great condition! No scratches or cracks anywhere. There was only a sticker on the back that was super easy to get off. I was so scared this would be a scam, but its been two days and it works good! It only gets hot when i play roblox, but my phone does that too. I love it sm ! It also came with a fast charger and headpiece that works amazingly. Definitely recommend
this refurbished iPad looks and runs like new. I was a little skeptical buying a refurbished unit thinking it would be scratched and dented, however this was not the case
First off let me say the rose good color was it for me.
I can easily pick up my iPad and put it in almost all my hand bags..trips are so much better being able to turn my iPad into a tv with the screen size..

Excellent performance and nice design. The iPad A2197 7th Gen has great functionality and a powerful processor. The 10.2" screen has a vibrant display. The 32GB storage capacity provides ample space for apps, photos, and more. The WiFi connectivity ensures seamless internet access. The space grey color adds a nice touch. Overall, a top-notch tablet offering great value for the price.
My iPad came in good condition and came with a charger. The charger is fast and I still use it now. The iPad also came precharged so I was able to set it up. The iPad also runs out charge rarely. It has helped me slot in work, it also updates fast and a real life changing purchase.
The ipad Recieved was in great condition.  Much need for my daily task
I love my IPad, I have no issues with it. It’s like having a brand new one.
It works and we haven’t had any problems. Just an iPad for the kids and works great!
Great purchase. I am so happy with this Apple product.
It took a while to get information from the old iPad onto this one, but it’s working like a brand new one! Perfect for our granddaughter.
Good handling like  new my daughter really loves it and got a Bluey case to go along with it and headphones so she is set to enjoy
CHECK YOUR MODEL. I received this item on March 25th. bought a case today for a 10.2 7th generation and lo and behold, it didn’t fit. I looked at the info for the case to make sure I didn’t grab the wrong size and it was for the 7th gen. I checked the model info on the iPad and yep not what I ordered. I wasted $20 on liquid glass for it and I’m glad I realized when I did because I almost wouldn’t have been able to return it
I love my iPad it came with a charger looks brand new
This refurbished IPad is perfect. Literally no flaws or cracks. Awesome camera quality. Perfect for my 4 year old.
Great product worth my money everything is like brand new
Works great, very happy with my purchase. Everything is as it should be
Very happy with my purchase & Best Buy’s customer service
Good quality and fair pricing for this product! It works great
The ipad literally had fingerprints on the screen and gross sticker residue on the back right out of the box. The battery was at 52% when turned on and within an hour of trying to set up it was down to 7%. The screen also had slihht but visible damage. I genuinely feel like it may have just been wiped of data and then repacked. Lesson learned on these non-manufacturer refurbished items
I bought this product in refurbished condition for my girlfriend and it's worked out great! She didn't need the absolute newest version and won't use the camera function so a slightly older model would fit just fine. 

Everything works like new and the physical condition of the unit was also like new with no noticeable defects or blemishes. The screen is free of scratches or marks and the performance is snappy and responsive. 

Overall, a good purchase. My girlfriend is very happy with her iPad and I was able to save some money on a refurbished, prior model.
Bought this refurbished IPad. It has worked like new. No glitches and great price. I would recommend this product.
After reading previous reviews, I was a bit hesitant to make this purchase. I was also unsure based on the 14-day return policy. I dreaded getting to day 15 and something going wrong but I  really wanted an affordable option and this seemed to be a great deal. I am so glad I took the chance as this iPad is in great condition. It seemed like new with only a light scratch or two. The battery life could be better but this is my first iPad and I am not sure how long the battery should last. I highly recommend getting a case and screen protector to keep your device in good shape.
Came in very good condition, strange is came with different charger and plug in! But overall good quality for refurbished item!
Excelent product, affordable price. Other than the low quality Charger, great iPad.
This ipad is really working good for me. I needed a new one and this was it.
Great product. Looks in perfect condition for being refurbished. Runs so smoothly. Very happy
I was very reluctant to buy a refurbished IPad, but was pleasantly surprised when I received it.  It looks like new and  is working fine so far. I haven't had it long enough to rate the battery life yet.
Good product at good price !! This is the second one I buy !! My Daughter love it is a good side , also convenience to take anywhere . Best Buy have the goods produce at good deal and price,
This has been working great for the first month. The ipad arrived in excellent condition. No issues with setup. I chose this because we have historically always bought refurbished apple products, but they only had very expensive iPads available and we needed something simple for music/entertainment at home.
Haven't given it to my son yet but seems to be in good condition. Only thing was they sent the new style charger instead of the older charging cord. But happy with the price.
Excellent iPad, in great condition, and delivered as promised. I saved a lot of money and will continue to purchase refurbished items from Best Buy.
Using it as a control panel on a wall mount for all of app controlled stuff.  Not much memory but don't need that for my application.
Received delivery earlier than anticipated. Everything was in good shape, and all is operating well.
Great price. I don’t see a reason not to refurbished iPad. Looks and works as good as a new one for cheap.
The iPad is okay , there was not an accurate description on the device so I was flying blind when it came out purchasing it. When it comes “as is” products , there should be a description about it not just “geek squad certified” . The a decent size dent in the back casing, you can see faint lines in the lcd screen under the glass which means it’ll probably have to be replaced sooner than later as well as the home button. Honestly it should’ve been priced more at $100 and not $199. The charger that was given to me was fine, looked like an actual apple charger but the box can’t be used at the charger is usb and the box is usb-c.
This was my first time buying a refurbished item and I was not disappointed! The iPad was in excellent condition and was delivered quickly.
Does, well for the price…lags a little on some sitea
Nice quality for the price.  I was a little reluctant being that the iPad is refurbished, however, I am pleased with my purchase.
