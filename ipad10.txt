Positives:

Bigger and better screen: The 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display is a significant upgrade from the 10.2-inch screen of the 9th gen iPad, offering more screen real estate and a sharper viewing experience.

Faster performance: The A14 Bionic chip provides a noticeable performance boost over the A13 Bionic chip in the 9th gen iPad, making the 10th gen iPad feel zippy and responsive even for demanding tasks.

Improved cameras: The 12MP wide-angle front camera and 12MP ultra-wide rear camera are both significant upgrades from the previous model, offering better quality for video calls, selfies, and photos.

Modern design: The 10th gen iPad adopts the design language of the iPad Air and Pro, with slim bezels, a Touch ID button on the top bezel, and a USB-C port.

Negatives:

Higher price: The 10th gen iPad starts at $449 but you can find it cheaper on sale.

1st gen Apple Pencil support: The 10th gen iPad only supports the 1st generation Apple Pencil, which charges awkwardly by plugging directly into the Lightning port. The newer 2nd generation Apple Pencil charges magnetically and offers a more premium experience.
I’ve had it for a while now and I’m super pleased with it. The screen size is great and it’s really nice to be able to use my planning apps without worrying about battery issues like before (I had an older 7th gen iPad). The pink color is cute too.
Hi Guys, This is my second ipad, the first was an ipad air I bought years ago? I got really good support and info from the friendly and patient sales person at Best Buy as i am basically just an average hobby user and not a geek!
So far i have found the 10th Gen pad quite good and easy to navigate with lots of possibillities to use as a basic photo album, taking notes, marking my date calender, listening to music, watching movies for leisure as well. I walked into the store without any idea as to what kind of ipad to look at and I walked out in 30 minutes with a great buy! 
Wasnt too sure about the additional keyboard so i held back on that for the moment! been using it for the last week and the battery is still at 90% ? just awesome,..really pleased at my choice..and the metallic blue colour is soo soothing and pleasing to look at!
I love my iPad. The color so pretty and I got a case to match. The camera quality so good. The iPad sooo big I love it. U can watch movies, do home work, play games, and more. The price was very much so reasonable. Buy it, they will deliver it in no time.
Due to my new job, I needed a tablet. After lookimg at many, I decided to buy this one because of its size, price, color and functionality. Truly my best purchase in a while!!!!! Love it!!!!
Got this as a birthday gift. A lot bigger than I expected and not heavy. Wonderful speed and had quality. A great substitute for a laptop of in school. Would recommend getting keyboard and Apple Pencil. Mainly using for drawing and school. I love this device better than the really big iPad Pro. I literally didn’t charge it for almost two weeks after receiving it.
Very happy with the accessibility/ capability features on the device. It’s primarily used for schoolwork. Though once I logged in with my previous apple info my storage ran out. This device has more storage than my phone so you may want to create a new Apple ID if you use a lot of data. The color is vibrant and material is easy to clean from oil stains , water and dust. Though the color in the picture is brighter. In person the yellow seems more gold. It pairs via Bluetooth with a generic Apple Pencil from Amazon. Touch ID sensitive and secure. I’ve had it for 2 weeks now and if I consistently use it even for streaming, so far I’m only charging about every 3-4 days.
Excellent quality, highly capable iPad. I use it for flying and home office work coupled with a Logitech keyboard folio. Very portable, great display, and good battery life.
Great for the price, smooth and good size, amazing speakers, great battery life

I love this product. I purchased it for school and so far have not had any issues. The battery life is good and it works perfectly. The price was also really good and it was worth the money.
I got this for my nephew's birthday and he loved it! The size is perfect, performance is great for the games he likes to play, the screen is big and vibrant. He couldnt be happier
This apple 10th generation iPad I bought COMPLETELY NEW is great! I got it for 400 dollars which is 50 dollars cheaper than what apple is selling it for and it is the exact same product. The customer service at Best Buy was excellent. I am 16 years old and worked all summer to buy this ipad and when I walked into the store I felt lost and excited but with the help of the staff at Best Buy I was able to easily navigate my way through finding the best choices in my purchase. I had researched the product before I bought it and thought I knew everything there was about this ipad and the BestBuy team shown me more than what I already knew allowing me more insight into if I was making the best purchase. (Which I did) I highly recommend getting all your technology products at Best Buy or really anything you need that Best Buy supplies. 10/10 
For the quality of iPad:
Battery lasts super long like 2 days
The charger that came with it charges it super fast.
I already dropped it without a case or anything and it didn’t break so super durable.
Bright screen with vivid colors.
I love this iPad. The color is beautiful and it’s very fast as far as processing speeds. It has split screen and slide over view though they’re useful I’ve found they don’t work with all apps. I sell crafts and this is perfect for late at night when I’m in bed and I come up with an idea and I don’t want to get up. I can use canva and all the apps I need to create. I purchased an off brand pen off of Amazon and it works very well with my iPad.
I got this so I could draw more often, and I don't regret it! I love how smooth this tablet is and how quickly it turns on the next morning. I'm honestly shocked how amazing this tablet is compared to others I've used. The battery lasts days for me as I use this for drawing and nothing else, so it's perfect when the electricity is out or when I'm on the go. 
Also, it charges so fast! I plug in my Apple Pen, and it charges from 19% to 40% in seconds to minutes.

It's pretty crazy to see how this tablet runs, as I've never had an Apple product before, and with this, it feels like I jumped many years in tech; I feel like I've been missing out on iPads this whole time.

I will say this: I have not tested the durability, but it hasn't broken from drawing and carrying it everywhere, and I have a case, so I wouldn't break it with a fall or dropping it, so I give it a thumbs up so far. The display is beautiful in person, and the colors are wonderful for drawing, so I would give it a 10/10 for the colors alone. The only issue I'm facing is that I can't figure out how to stop the display from changing the brightness. Sometimes the brightness will darken after 30 minutes to an hour, and I can't find a setting to fix it. Other than that, I love it and would highly recommend it, especially this holiday season.
I love my new yellow iPad! Battery seems to last a long time even while watching movies back to back!
I recently purchased the iPad 10th generation from Best Buy, and I couldn't be happier with my decision. From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek design and vibrant 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display impressed me. The color accuracy and brightness make it perfect for streaming, browsing, and even light photo editing.

Performance-wise, the A14 Bionic chip handles multitasking like a champ. Whether it's using multiple apps simultaneously or playing graphics-intensive games, the iPad delivers a smooth, lag-free experience. It's also a fantastic device for productivity—pairing it with the Apple Pencil (1st gen) and Magic Keyboard transforms it into a capable work companion.

Battery life is excellent, easily lasting a full day with mixed usage. The front-facing camera is great for FaceTime calls, and the USB-C port is a welcome addition for faster charging and broader accessory compatibility.

Overall, the iPad 10th gen is a perfect blend of performance, functionality, and price. I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile tablet for both personal and professional use
I love the color and the size it’s very compact and light and very durable.
Love this tablet so much and it’s pink so it’s just the icing on the cake. I mainly bought for note taking since I’m in college  and it’s been great. No more running around my looking for my notes. If you are think of buying don’t think just buy. ANDDDD I also got this for cheap thanks to being on sale!!!!
This iPad is a game-changer. It looks cool, sleek and fits my vibe. My iPad transforms into this sleek laptop. The screen is a total showstopper. It turns my Netflix nights into a cinematic experience, and photos. They look like a gallery on this thing. The storage is roomy, and my iPad and iCloud work together like a dream team. The camera is like a memory machine – not just for pics but making video calls look sharp. The battery life is insane – it lasts from my morning coffee to late-night Netflix binging.
Very easy process at best buy, Got my dream Ipad very quickly! I love my new Ipad & the process I went through to buy it, I’m very satisfied and have no regrets. My favorite color is pink & going back to school soon with it will make everything easier for me, It’s worth it.
I love my iPad. It was a gift from my daughter. I’m retired and disabled and this was the perfect gift to keep me entertained with watching movies, games, FaceTime with my family and much more. The quality of video is good it’s a big screen. I’d prefer Face ID lock but finger print unlock is good to once you get the hang of the functions it’s good. The iPad isn’t heavy at all it’s light. The battery life is long. A perfect gift.
This was one of the best gifts purchased for our son's 10 th birthday. He absolutely LOVEs his Ipad and has not put it down since. The purchasing process was so super easy and the customer service representative was extremely helpful. We will definitely be using Best Buy and apple products again.
I recently got my hands on the 10th generation Apple iPad, and it has exceeded my expectations! From performance to design, this device is an absolute game-changer.

Performance: The A14 Bionic chip makes everything lightning fast—whether I’m multitasking, streaming, or using multiple apps simultaneously, it handles it all with ease. Games and videos are smooth, with no lag.

Display: The 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display is stunning. Colors are vibrant, and the resolution makes watching Netflix or editing photos a visual treat.

Battery Life: The battery life is impressive. It easily lasts me through a full day of use, including video calls, browsing, and streaming.

Design: I love the sleek, modern look. It’s lightweight and feels premium in my hands. Apple’s switch to a USB-C port makes charging and data transfer faster, which is a big plus!

Additional Features: The compatibility with the Apple Pencil (Gen 1) and Magic Keyboard Folio has made it my go-to device for both work and entertainment. It’s versatile enough for productivity on the go or casual use at home.

Overall, the 10th gen iPad strikes the perfect balance between power, style, and value. Whether you’re a student, professional, or just looking for a reliable tablet, this one won’t disappoint!
I love the color of the ipad first of all. I love the square shape . I love the screen of the whole entire thing . Its perfect honestly . The screen is very wide perfect for watching tv shows and facetiming. I absolutely love it . Will be purchasing another for my gf. The battery life lasts WAY longer than my last ipad.
I love my new Ipad! I signed up for e-mails from Best Buy, so I am aware of when their sales are. When the Ipad came up on sale, I jumped on it! It was so easy to order and pick up at the store!
But, here is the kicker. About a week after I picked up my Ipad, Best Buy had a bigger sale on the same Ipad. I call Best Buy and got 20.00 dollars more off the sale price!
I absolutely love this thing! It runs amazing with no lag or performance issues. The only thing I don’t like about is that my pencil will not connect and charge on the side of it, while yet, the apple Magic Keyboard and some other premium brand keyboards will. It just doesn’t make any sense. But other than that, I truly love it. There isn’t too much of a selection out there of keyboards or cases though, but that really has nothing to do with this. It also has extremely great looking graphics and sound. Not to mention that the tablet itself is very nice and clean looking! The blue color tone with just the right amount of sparkle and shine to it is just beautiful!  While still seeming very durable thus far! Although, I would still obviously recommend a good case and screen protector for it though, you must always protect the assets!

Either way, it was ultimately a great purchase for both me and my oldest daughter that’s 5. She absolutely loves it and plays her games on it with no problems. For the price, you 100% cannot beat it. I am thankful I had an affordable option for a great tablet. If I could give an extra star I would! I would highly recommend it for just about any age group. It’s performance is just unbeatable at the price.
This ipad does exactly what I wanted it to. It was my first ipad/tablet and I am extremely pleased with it. I feel it was a great model choice that fits all my needs while not breaking the bank. I use it mostly to write (journals, notes, etc.). It writes just like you would with a piece of paper, but I don't have to be wasteful or deal with eraser marks. 

The battery life is excellent. I go days using it to write, stream videos/movies, and read books. It has a USB-C port and the camera is positioned so it is at the top when horizontal. All great features. I really don't have anything negative to say. 

I was afraid it might be one of those things I thought I would use all the time, but find I don't. Quite the opposite. I use it more than I expected and keep finding new things to use it for. 

Bestbuy had better deals and the security of knowing I could get in person returns/support. I was also able to get Apple Care through Bestbuy.

*The photo shows the product with a case and screen protector.
It was a gift, but I love it. Great size does everything I want from it.. From what I was told great price as well..
Still getting used to it, after an earlier gen iPad Air. Put Zagg screen protector on, fastened to an ESR keyboard, and we are ready to roll. Great screen. Take some getting used to where the touch id is now, but easy. We are older users and have managed to figure it out. Still loading apps. Very fast. Next is a stylus. Noticeably heavier, but expected that. Great camera.
I LOVE MY IPAD!! I know it may seem like I’m over exaggerating lol but I take it everywhere with me and I have not had any problems out of it. The battery life is great, I use it for my Bible, a few games, Netflix and business uses.
I got this as a gift for my friend, who loves to travel and recently broke her laptop, she loves it because it’s light weight, easy to use, and she can bring it with her everywhere at ease. The white color is so aesthetic and there’s so many cool new features like motion focus or zoom on FaceTime! I also bought the add on case with keyboard for work efficiency, lovely purchase!
Originally, I bought the 64 GB. That was a mistake. Just the apps alone that I have took up all the space. I recommend getting minimum 256 gb. Otherwise, you will be disappointed. Don’t buy this expecting to use as thoroughly as you would laptop or a desktop. that’s not what it’s for if you want to do that I would recommend getting a MacBook or windows laptop. However, it is nice to have something you can fluidly switch between what you’re doing on your phone and on a bigger screen. It’s nice on short trips and flights. Overall, I’m happy.
