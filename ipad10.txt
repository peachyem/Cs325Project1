Positives:

Bigger and better screen: The 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display is a significant upgrade from the 10.2-inch screen of the 9th gen iPad, offering more screen real estate and a sharper viewing experience.

Faster performance: The A14 Bionic chip provides a noticeable performance boost over the A13 Bionic chip in the 9th gen iPad, making the 10th gen iPad feel zippy and responsive even for demanding tasks.

Improved cameras: The 12MP wide-angle front camera and 12MP ultra-wide rear camera are both significant upgrades from the previous model, offering better quality for video calls, selfies, and photos.

Modern design: The 10th gen iPad adopts the design language of the iPad Air and Pro, with slim bezels, a Touch ID button on the top bezel, and a USB-C port.

Negatives:

Higher price: The 10th gen iPad starts at $449 but you can find it cheaper on sale.

1st gen Apple Pencil support: The 10th gen iPad only supports the 1st generation Apple Pencil, which charges awkwardly by plugging directly into the Lightning port. The newer 2nd generation Apple Pencil charges magnetically and offers a more premium experience.
I’ve had it for a while now and I’m super pleased with it. The screen size is great and it’s really nice to be able to use my planning apps without worrying about battery issues like before (I had an older 7th gen iPad). The pink color is cute too.
I love my iPad. The color so pretty and I got a case to match. The camera quality so good. The iPad sooo big I love it. U can watch movies, do home work, play games, and more. The price was very much so reasonable. Buy it, they will deliver it in no time.
Hi Guys, This is my second ipad, the first was an ipad air I bought years ago? I got really good support and info from the friendly and patient sales person at Best Buy as i am basically just an average hobby user and not a geek!
So far i have found the 10th Gen pad quite good and easy to navigate with lots of possibillities to use as a basic photo album, taking notes, marking my date calender, listening to music, watching movies for leisure as well. I walked into the store without any idea as to what kind of ipad to look at and I walked out in 30 minutes with a great buy! 
Wasnt too sure about the additional keyboard so i held back on that for the moment! been using it for the last week and the battery is still at 90% ? just awesome,..really pleased at my choice..and the metallic blue colour is soo soothing and pleasing to look at!
Got this as a birthday gift. A lot bigger than I expected and not heavy. Wonderful speed and had quality. A great substitute for a laptop of in school. Would recommend getting keyboard and Apple Pencil. Mainly using for drawing and school. I love this device better than the really big iPad Pro. I literally didn’t charge it for almost two weeks after receiving it.
Due to my new job, I needed a tablet. After lookimg at many, I decided to buy this one because of its size, price, color and functionality. Truly my best purchase in a while!!!!! Love it!!!!
Very happy with the accessibility/ capability features on the device. It’s primarily used for schoolwork. Though once I logged in with my previous apple info my storage ran out. This device has more storage than my phone so you may want to create a new Apple ID if you use a lot of data. The color is vibrant and material is easy to clean from oil stains , water and dust. Though the color in the picture is brighter. In person the yellow seems more gold. It pairs via Bluetooth with a generic Apple Pencil from Amazon. Touch ID sensitive and secure. I’ve had it for 2 weeks now and if I consistently use it even for streaming, so far I’m only charging about every 3-4 days.
I love this product. I purchased it for school and so far have not had any issues. The battery life is good and it works perfectly. The price was also really good and it was worth the money.
I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS IPAD ITS SO GOOD WORKS PERFECTLY THE COLOR IS AMAZING   AND a GOOD IPAD TO START OFF WITH THIS is my first iPad ever and this was a perfect purchase is you don’t know what iPad to get I totally recommend this one it’s the perfect size and all the Color’s are amazing it’s has a amazing display and function well it’s has good battery life and good for taking notes and FaceTime watching movies and playing so games good for work and zooms over all good for any one who just wants the iPad for games,work or school this iPad is a great choice
Great for the price, smooth and good size, amazing speakers, great battery life
Excellent quality, highly capable iPad. I use it for flying and home office work coupled with a Logitech keyboard folio. Very portable, great display, and good battery life.

I got this for my nephew's birthday and he loved it! The size is perfect, performance is great for the games he likes to play, the screen is big and vibrant. He couldnt be happier
This apple 10th generation iPad I bought COMPLETELY NEW is great! I got it for 400 dollars which is 50 dollars cheaper than what apple is selling it for and it is the exact same product. The customer service at Best Buy was excellent. I am 16 years old and worked all summer to buy this ipad and when I walked into the store I felt lost and excited but with the help of the staff at Best Buy I was able to easily navigate my way through finding the best choices in my purchase. I had researched the product before I bought it and thought I knew everything there was about this ipad and the BestBuy team shown me more than what I already knew allowing me more insight into if I was making the best purchase. (Which I did) I highly recommend getting all your technology products at Best Buy or really anything you need that Best Buy supplies. 10/10 
For the quality of iPad:
Battery lasts super long like 2 days
The charger that came with it charges it super fast.
I already dropped it without a case or anything and it didn’t break so super durable.
Bright screen with vivid colors.
I recently got my hands on the 10th generation Apple iPad, and it has exceeded my expectations! From performance to design, this device is an absolute game-changer.

Battery Life: The battery life is impressive. It easily lasts me through a full day of use, including video calls, browsing, and streaming.

Additional Features: The compatibility with the Apple Pencil (Gen 1) and Magic Keyboard Folio has made it my go-to device for both work and entertainment. It’s versatile enough for productivity on the go or casual use at home.

Overall, the 10th gen iPad strikes the perfect balance between power, style, and value. Whether you’re a student, professional, or just looking for a reliable tablet, this one won’t disappoint!
Love this tablet so much and it’s pink so it’s just the icing on the cake. I mainly bought for note taking since I’m in college  and it’s been great. No more running around my looking for my notes. If you are think of buying don’t think just buy. ANDDDD I also got this for cheap thanks to being on sale!!!!
This iPad is a game-changer. It looks cool, sleek and fits my vibe. My iPad transforms into this sleek laptop. The screen is a total showstopper. It turns my Netflix nights into a cinematic experience, and photos. They look like a gallery on this thing. The storage is roomy, and my iPad and iCloud work together like a dream team. The camera is like a memory machine – not just for pics but making video calls look sharp. The battery life is insane – it lasts from my morning coffee to late-night Netflix binging.
Very easy process at best buy, Got my dream Ipad very quickly! I love my new Ipad & the process I went through to buy it, I’m very satisfied and have no regrets. My favorite color is pink & going back to school soon with it will make everything easier for me, It’s worth it.
I love my new Ipad! I signed up for e-mails from Best Buy, so I am aware of when their sales are. When the Ipad came up on sale, I jumped on it! It was so easy to order and pick up at the store!
But, here is the kicker. About a week after I picked up my Ipad, Best Buy had a bigger sale on the same Ipad. I call Best Buy and got 20.00 dollars more off the sale price!
I love my iPad. It was a gift from my daughter. I’m retired and disabled and this was the perfect gift to keep me entertained with watching movies, games, FaceTime with my family and much more. The quality of video is good it’s a big screen. I’d prefer Face ID lock but finger print unlock is good to once you get the hang of the functions it’s good. The iPad isn’t heavy at all it’s light. The battery life is long. A perfect gift.
I love the color of the ipad first of all. I love the square shape . I love the screen of the whole entire thing . Its perfect honestly . The screen is very wide perfect for watching tv shows and facetiming. I absolutely love it . Will be purchasing another for my gf. The battery life lasts WAY longer than my last ipad.
I absolutely love this thing! It runs amazing with no lag or performance issues. The only thing I don’t like about is that my pencil will not connect and charge on the side of it, while yet, the apple Magic Keyboard and some other premium brand keyboards will. It just doesn’t make any sense. But other than that, I truly love it. There isn’t too much of a selection out there of keyboards or cases though, but that really has nothing to do with this. It also has extremely great looking graphics and sound. Not to mention that the tablet itself is very nice and clean looking! The blue color tone with just the right amount of sparkle and shine to it is just beautiful!  While still seeming very durable thus far! Although, I would still obviously recommend a good case and screen protector for it though, you must always protect the assets!

Either way, it was ultimately a great purchase for both me and my oldest daughter that’s 5. She absolutely loves it and plays her games on it with no problems. For the price, you 100% cannot beat it. I am thankful I had an affordable option for a great tablet. If I could give an extra star I would! I would highly recommend it for just about any age group. It’s performance is just unbeatable at the price.
This ipad does exactly what I wanted it to. It was my first ipad/tablet and I am extremely pleased with it. I feel it was a great model choice that fits all my needs while not breaking the bank. I use it mostly to write (journals, notes, etc.). It writes just like you would with a piece of paper, but I don't have to be wasteful or deal with eraser marks. 

The battery life is excellent. I go days using it to write, stream videos/movies, and read books. It has a USB-C port and the camera is positioned so it is at the top when horizontal. All great features. I really don't have anything negative to say. 

I was afraid it might be one of those things I thought I would use all the time, but find I don't. Quite the opposite. I use it more than I expected and keep finding new things to use it for. 

Bestbuy had better deals and the security of knowing I could get in person returns/support. I was also able to get Apple Care through Bestbuy.

*The photo shows the product with a case and screen protector.
It was a gift, but I love it. Great size does everything I want from it.. From what I was told great price as well..
Still getting used to it, after an earlier gen iPad Air. Put Zagg screen protector on, fastened to an ESR keyboard, and we are ready to roll. Great screen. Take some getting used to where the touch id is now, but easy. We are older users and have managed to figure it out. Still loading apps. Very fast. Next is a stylus. Noticeably heavier, but expected that. Great camera.
l've been enjoying my iPad 10th generation, the color is beautiful, the speakers are loud and the battery life is great on it!! This is my first time purchasing an iPad and it was definitely worth every penny.
Being a first time mom my fiance and I were thinking of ways to keep our daughter entertained during trips and small outings so we figured lets get her a tablet but with me being a small business owner i needed something a little more hi-tech so we settled on the ipad and we have NO REGRETS, its easy to use and set up and very convenient being able to link my current icloud to it allows me to answer calls while still managing my apps thru the ipad. It charges fast and stays on for hours even when playing ms rachel for hours haha. The color and size is everything the shiny pink goes perfect with me being a girl mom i absolutely adore this ipad. I recommend it to ANYONE not just familys or business owners my younger brother often uses it for school work and my mother loves it for streaming apps to watch her shows and movies its very versatile and i’ll definitely be enjoying it for the long run.
This Apple I Pad is fantastic ! Its easy to use. The display is nice and bright and clear. It is perfect for every use. Game playing is a breeze as well as using the web. Excellent battery life as well. I highly recommend.
Originally, I bought the 64 GB. That was a mistake. Just the apps alone that I have took up all the space. I recommend getting minimum 256 gb. Otherwise, you will be disappointed. Don’t buy this expecting to use as thoroughly as you would laptop or a desktop. that’s not what it’s for if you want to do that I would recommend getting a MacBook or windows laptop. However, it is nice to have something you can fluidly switch between what you’re doing on your phone and on a bigger screen. It’s nice on short trips and flights. Overall, I’m happy.
The iPad 10th Generation is a powerhouse! The A13 Bionic chip ensures lightning-fast performance, and the 10.2-inch Retina display is a visual treat. Its compatibility with the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard adds immense versatility. Impressive battery life and a sleek design make it a top-notch choice for work and play. Highly recommend!
I got this as a gift for my friend, who loves to travel and recently broke her laptop, she loves it because it’s light weight, easy to use, and she can bring it with her everywhere at ease. The white color is so aesthetic and there’s so many cool new features like motion focus or zoom on FaceTime! I also bought the add on case with keyboard for work efficiency, lovely purchase!
I just made the change from a Samsung tablet to the iPad.  I love the size (10.9 in) and how easy it is to use!  Very user friendly, although I am still working on how to use a few applications. I got a pink one so I could find it !  Also like the case that I found for it.
I upgraded from an iPad 7th generation to the 10th generation and do not regret it. The screen is large enough for both digital art and note taking, making it great for digital artists and college students. There is also a significant upgrade in the battery as it quickly charges and maintains a long battery life. I highly recommend.
Love the color,size the screen is bigger with a smaller black side on screen,faster,better battery life.
This iPad was purchased for a bunch of upcoming trips.  Our kids were getting just a tad too old for the Kindle Fire tablets.  Apple products just work better for our family and everything synced together nicely.  Now each child has an iPad, although, they are the family iPads and the kids just use them when needed.  Our kids don't get phones so they need something to entertain them during long car rides.  They actually do a lot of drawing on them.  They are great for art apps.  I think my kids spend more time on Canva than watching shows! I highly recommend the iPad! I wanted the pink, but wasn't in stock.  We received the blue and we love it!
I love it! Has a nice sized screen.  Easy to use! I love it's capabilities! This is a great quality item.  I would definitely recommend this item for other users. I've never had an ipad , this is my first Apple product. Definitely would purchase another apple product.
Delivered quick and safely. Packaging seemed untouched. Came with all extra accessories included. I like it cause it’s not too small and it fits in my purse easily so I can take it everywhere with me and would recommend to purchases screen is real big but not too big like a laptop/computer.
Upgraded experience from my previous iPad. Budget better screen and performance. Got a nice blue Color.
My son has mitochondrial disease and he has no motor or body function and the worker at Best Buy helps me choose this device specifically because my son stays entertained by and learns on his iPad. I would buy this 10 times over again.
Bought this for my wife, great product, was on sale, so the deal was even better. Using it to watch movies, do work, video conference etc. Perfect for everyday life. 10/10 would order something from Apple again.
I LOVE MY NEW IPAD ITS MY FAVORITE COLOR PINK nice size I refuse to take it out the case because I’m not breaking this one. I convinced my sister to buy one
I bought an IPad 10 generation as a gift for my daughter as an early birthday gift, since her old one was giving her problems. She loved it, but she misses the home button on the side. She also likes that it doesn’t take so much time to charge and is easier to play certain games on it. She loves that it’s lighter.
Great purchase!  Very suitable for the price and parameters I need for working with graphics.  Amazing color and speed.
I love how long my battery last on my iPad one of my best decisions to get it I love the color I want to get the Bible gum pink one next!!!!
He’s turning addition to apples line of offering not just aesthetic appeal but also impressive functionality. The blue finish on the iPad is sleek and sophisticated,complementing device is slim profile and lightweight build. The retina display remains a highlight delivering sharp visuals perfect for both work entertainment and school apples introduced to revamped interface the for iPad making navigation seemlees and intuitive. I love my I pad!
I Love The Size And The Color Of The IPAD. I Also Love How Long The Battery Life Is For The IPAD
It is a great tablet. The battery lasts long. The only thing I don’t like is that since the screen is two pieces, after some time I believe that it will collect dust inside the screen.
Came in good shape happy with my order
It’s the right size and everything just like the picture good for the price
Love this ipad. I got it for my son and he absolutely loves it. Super nice and clean display. Great size too. I ended up buying 3 of them one for my son and two for my nieces.
I love my ipad its what i use everyday and you should get it if you want one oh and it big but you will get use to it
I've really liked it so far! Display is okay and the price drop makes it worth!
Great IPad ! Fast working ! easy set up ! I love the color of it !
The 10th generation iPad is a significant upgrade over its predecessors, offering a blend of modern design, powerful performance, and useful features. However, the higher price point and some limitations, like the lack of support for the latest Apple Pencil, might be a consideration for some users2. Overall, it remains a strong contender in the tablet market, especially for those looking for a versatile and capable device. I use it for school and it works great. Seeing all of the discounts for this Ipad popping up I wish I could have waited to buy it. Overall it’s amazing!
I purchased the iPad because I recently started a small business and it was very difficult working off my phone. It has been awesome for me since the purchase. I am so much more organized and able to do so many things now. Great affordable price also! Thanks Best Buy, It’s been real! LA
This is my first Apple anything...I absolutely love it!! I love the features and the security that comes with the brand. I only buy my electronics from best buy..way back since my PS3 days...so I had to grab it while it was on sale...I only trust best buy for my electronics and they did not disappoint. My ipad has a large screen and I am able to do so much with it. The battery didnt wear down for days and of course the quality is good and true to size..no cumbersome screen edge fillers..oh and it arrived on time and was packaged well. I chose the yellow ipad...it is such a pretty color....especially with my protector case! I had a Samsung tablet..but it was no ipad!! So...with the sale price and the fact that I felt a need to have something Apple in my life...and I trusted the purchase...there was no passing it up. ... I am glad I got it. I use Samsung phones...but now with my ipad, my sisters and nieces dont have to make an extra android group chat especially for me anymore!! And I can finally facetime!! #excited #winning #affordableapple  #newappler #bestbuyisyourbestbet
I never really liked my last ipad but i used my friends recently and decided to get this version. Luckily i got to trade my other one in and that took the price of this down to something i was willing to pay. not being on the apple ecosystem didn't allow me to use all this ipad is able to do but i got an apple pen and have enjoyed using that with this ipad. It is easier to use and quicker, i find i use it daily as well. I'm definitely happy with it!
The iPad works very well. My daughter enjoys it very much. She gotten use to the side camera and starting to like it better that way. She had the iPad Pro and gotten messed up from bringing it in the bathroom with her. Couldn’t even trade it in for anything. But the price of this iPad is very reasonable and work just as good.
My sister is new to the apple eco system. A MacBook was to advanced, as she is still learning IOS. So this Ipad 10th gen is the perfect solution. It has a great facetime camera, speakers and all the functions she needs to write. With the trackpad it really teaches the macbook trackpad gestures & keyboard placement. The specs on this ipad are similar to an I-phone 12 series. But the ipad has USBC and trackpad pad folio support. Also it is no slouch! 
It was a great gift for her birthday! She loves it! Adding a 3rd party was not good, eventually getting the white 10th gen folio keyboard. Which is mindblowing. It makes it easy to transition files, use applications, and when the magic keyboard is on it functions more like a macbook. It truly is a great Ipad! This a 10/10 for the price of of $350 on sale! As she slowly transitions we will be back at Best Buy to get a macbook when she is ready. I highly recommend going into the store to pick out devices! Then you will truly know what you want!

The battery life is amazing with a keyboard even, it just connects automatically. My sister raves about this ipad since she has been using it! The ease of use is great as it has the tips section, so transferring windows files to a flash drive has been an easy learning curve!
Its always good to have an extra device.Best Buy has the best price for it! And its pinkkk
I like the amazing battery. Full screen display, Touch ID.
My experience with the Ipad was amazing . It holds charge and take amazing selfies. Its sleek design , high resolution display and responsive touch interface make it a pleasure to use various tasks such as browsing the web, watching videos , playing games , productivity and making phone calls. It helped me took drawing more serious with the pen it came with.  I would definitely recommend buying this device .
Great price! Love that I didn't have to spend a lot of money just to get a tablet. Open-box is just as good as brand-new! Loved the price (as previously stated) and I will definitely be recommending Best Buy Open-Boxes!
I love it i use this for my school work and it's amazing the color is bold and bright absolutely  love ,love it you have to get onw and i got it on sale!!!!
love my ipad just have to pay for more storage it the battery lasts all day doesn't get hot like an old model would
Contemplating and comparing for a long time with other models and I’m beyond happy with my decision to get this one. The color alone gives happy classy vibes! It does all I want and need it to do. Syncing is effortless and easy. So convenient and secure.
I’d say the only thing for me is the wanting to stay “keeping up with the jones’”, haha… and also I did think the yellow color would be brighter. The goldiness does have a fancy feel though. :) Apple keeps making it tough with newer models.
The iPad is perfect for the price. Exactly what i was expecting. The look and feel is good too. And screen is big enough to not miss your laptop ;)
This iPad is really good the color to the storage super amazing not like the others too bulky just the perfect size
I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday and he’s so happy! He doesn’t have a single complaint. Battery life is great, performance is great, graphics are great. It’s everything he wanted and then some!
Love it! Best purchase I've made in a while. Comes in handy when writing notes or drawing. Would recommend it to anyone who wants an iPad, plus the price is unbeatable!
I love my ipad very nice and love the color it’s a nice size
I love everything about it the hot pink color ! I love that it’s super big and I like the idea without button too.
I love it it’s pink and it’s super fast, it’s perfect size and I love it
i love my ipad my bf got it for me the color is everything the quality and battery life is 110/10 definitely recommend you will srsly fall in love with it i even recorded a youtube video on it and the quality was outstanding
Just like new! It came in the box and everything, the charger, stickers and the notes you would get in a regular apple product. The ipad inside is wrapped like if you got it new. No problems with it. Works just like new :) Saved me a lot of money instead of buying a new one.
I really enjoy my Ipad. The battery life is great. I have been using it for homework mostly.
Purchased this to replace the old one (still works but it’s really old). 
This tablets are really useful and fun.
In the picture I added a keyboard, sometimes I use it as a laptop.
I purchased the 10th generation iPad as a Mother’s Day gift for my wife. She absolutely loves it. I’m kind of jealous because I’m still using a ninth generation iPad, which is OK lol but I could use a $400 gift card to purchase me a 10th generation iPad ￼￼
I recently upgraded to the latest 10.9-inch iPad (10th generation) with Wi-Fi, boasting 64GB of storage, and I must say, it's a delightful experience. It is a true powerhouse that seamlessly combines performance, versatility, and a stunning display. Whether you're a student or creative individual like myself , this iPad offers an amazing experience that enhances productivity, fuels creativity, and keeps you connected like never before.
Very smooth running. Nice and big. Love the vibrant colors!
Better than buying a expensive  tab.definitely worth for the price ....screen size is good enough to watch movies and office work
The iPad 10th generation is a great iPad for those that simply love iPad. However, this particular one doesn’t carry all the high specs that the iPad Pro does. But that shouldn’t worry you if you are looking for one to simply browse the web, watch videos, play games, or even a bit of productivity such as emailing, facetiming, and jotting down notes. The design of this iPad is very modern as there is no longer a home button for the base models. With that being done, we get a larger screen for more display and better speakers for sound!
I love my iPad i was so excited when i picked it up.It’s more of a gold color than a yellow but it’s still beautiful this is one of the best purchases i made
I LOVE it! very practical and convenient!! you should get it too
I love it!! I have been wanting an iPad for a long time but was hesitant mainly because of the price. However, this particular model was so reasonable, especially since I bought it from BestBuy and not directly from Apple. I didn’t purchase the pen that is usually paired with this iPad model but it still functions just fine without it. I use it for streaming my favorite shows, scrolling through social media, and reading!
My favorite iPad I’m inlove with the color the screen is huge I use it like a portable tv and to do assignments
Great price. Excellent battery life  nice sound quality
Its pink and good size and good battery   Im loving it
Love the color & it’s a nice tablet for the price !
I love everything about it especially the color blue I recommend it I brought the cover with clear back so blue color can show
Love the color and the screen , it’s big enough and gives me access to all my Apple accessories!
I love my pink iPad, the battery life is amazing on it considering I use it every day. It connects really well with a cheap Bluetooth keyboard. The camera quality, audio, and microphone works well! Good for digital artists too with a Apple Pencil! I recommend getting the paper-like screen protector which is what I have for it !!
Purchased this IPad for my 11 year old granddaughter. It has a large and vibrant display, a very quick response and easy to setup.  The Find my Device feature allows me to track the device location at all times with my IPhone.  A good price.  Perfect for school work and entertainment as well. Word of advise:  Make sure to purchase a very good case with scene protection before you hand over to your child!
This is the best purchase i’ve ever made !! I usually think about the money I could’ve had after I spend it , but i haven’t after this. The color is beautiful , the battery life lasts me all day and more! I haven’t charged my Ipad since Tuesday (it’s Friday) it’s still has over 50%. The camera quality is just as good. I could use the Ipad for school, work , entertainment purposes etc. I am 100% satisfied and you will not regret buying this.
Excellent, Up to date iPad with everything you need and want at an exceptional price, not gonna lie it’s a decent size and easily accessible. (Also provided size comparison to iPhone 14 plus)
I got it for a birthday present and I loveeee it so much , there’s so much you can do on it . I use it for playing games and the games are so smooth . There’s no lag or no bogus quality . The battery lasts a while .
A fast tablet that connects quickly and easily wherever you go to get things done (or watched). It's powerful and can serve as a remote radio studio when I'm on the road. Battetlry charges fast and lasts a good long time. Bought it at Best Buy and went back for a screen protector to be added on, they did that for me quickly and easily. I recommend the magnetic keyboard add-on with the case and stand, too - brings it to a whole new level.
This iPad is my first, and I love it. It works great for all of my school needs as well as any other streaming or games I want. It's not too small, or big, and is easy to carry around. It's a slightly older model than the air and pro but works great!
Love my new iPad…the color, the features, the helpful sales associate at Best Buy.  My old iPad was outdated.  The Geek Squad agent rates 5+ stars for the transfer from old to new!  She was exceptional!!
Im in love with this color. Aside the fact tjat they moved the fronr camera to the side in landcape which was genius. Now on facetime and zoom meetings i can read a s still look like im lolking straight at the screen. Loce it!  Eveything is perfext and smooth.  I wish it was compatible with the new apple pencil but its not a deal breaker for the price your paying for.
The pink iPad 10.9 is a fantastic choice. It's not only stylish, but also very functional. The 10.9-inch screen is perfect for watching movies and videos, and the chip makes it super fast and responsive. Plus, it has an amazing camera, so you can take beautiful pictures and selfies. And let's not forget about the Apple Pencil support, which makes it great for taking notes and drawing. Overall, I think the pink iPad 10.9 is a great investment and you won't be disappointed with it!
I love it, the color looks exactly like the box. I like how it has touch like on iPhones. Overall a great product.
It’s works vary well been on it since it hit my hands was a great buy learned how to use it vary fast it basically tell you how to use it the split screen is so amazing being that I do work on I recommend this iPad to anyone
I love it!! It’s beneficial. I can carry it around with no issue. People tend to complain about the apple pencil having to be charged with the wire attachment but honestly its not all bad! I usually just charge it with my phone or my charger and it lasts me up to a week! Its worth getting. It’s better if you want the ipad with no homescreen.
I love this product. This is one of the best investments I have ever made. If you are a student, educator, business owner, or a minister like me, this is the tool for you! The color is so vibrant and sleek. It’s very lightweight yet durable. The batter stays in the 90-100 range all day with charging or using it and it really does last while using it! I recommend this 10/10.
I absolutely love this ipad! Ive always been a samsung kinda girl, and with this being my first official apple product im rethinking everything lol. Its easy to use and navigate and im exited figuring out and using all the features. Best purchased ive ever made hands down. 

Also it works well without the apple pencil but having the pencil makes the experience 10× better!
I llke the color and the size of the screen it’s perfect for on the go.
This iPad is a huge leap from the 9th generation. And when I bought it, it was $100 off. With BestBuy’s trade in program, I was able to get some money back for my 9th generation and put towards this purchase plus the sale price. It’s a win.
I purchased the 64GB version of the 10th generation iPad and are pleased with its performance, especially the screen size and graphics. Your online transaction and pickup at the Irvine Park Forest Best Buy went smoothly, with the staff being accommodating. The only drawback is the pricing of Apple accessories, which you find a bit expensive.
love my ipad so much!! so quick and convenient! one of my best purchases love having the apple pencil with it!
I have been using mi iPad for a while and I have no complaints. What I like the most is the clear y bright display because I can watch videos and movies on the go, read some ebook at home, and continue my work wherever I am. The battery live is very good. The USB-C gives me a peace of mind because it is most common and I could find a usb charge easily than a lighting one. And you can find a lot of accessories for IPads.
I got exactly what I wanted! Pickup was especially easy as a Best Buy member. Plus I even hot two because it was on sale and I could use affirm to pay in payments!! Overall awesome purchase.
The pink ads really arent doingnthe vibrant pink color it conesnin justice. Its so beautiful i almost hared to put it in a case. The battery life is amazing! From streaming, vlogging, and content storage the battery life keeps up with it all. I stream my favorite shows in thw most beautiful hd screen. Im actualky sad i delayed gettong one so long. Ad to cart is the only thing left to do, trust me!!
i got it in blue (my fav color) this is my first ipad i’ve ever gotten & i love it so much! the battery last a good while too
I bought this iPad for my daughter. She is delighted. I ordered it and 30 minutes later I went to the store and picked it up. Everything was fast and convenient. This is the best store!
I love this device !it’s a mini but it’s the size of a actual iPad , kinda like a bigger modeled iPhone and I love it . The color, the graphics , the display everything is nice .
Great iPad with great battery life and screen resolution. I take it everywhere and use it everywhere, the bathroom. Baseball games. EVEN WORK
