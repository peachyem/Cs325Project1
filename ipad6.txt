Love my new iPad. The tablet is great and so easy to set up.   I also purchased the protective cover. This was suggested by Best Buy once I added the iPad to my cart.  Awesome process.  Buy had amazing options on their website and checkout and shipping was quick and easy!!  I’ll definitely be a rerun customer.
It was a gift, for someone that’s fighting ovarian cancer
Is very very good i have two years ago I recommend that
I absolutely love this tablet! I never had a tablet before this and I absolutely love it! It can be a lil slow sometimes but nothing big, maybe a few seconds slower than the newer models. Also recent apps still work on it! such as Procreate, Hulu, and other streaming and selling/purchasing services! 
I absolutely love it and recommend, especially to anyone looking for something that'll do the job or in low budget!
Works very well! Glad I made the choice to purchase this tablet, which has a one year warranty.
The great Ipad , highly recommended . my twins are really enjoy with the Ipad .
My IPad came great, the quality was amazing. It charges fast & im satisfied with what came. Thanks
This ipad works great.  It is in very good physical condition, no scratches or dents.  The problem is the battery.  It drains fast and takes a long time to charge.
iPad arrived promptly and was in great condition.  Easy setup from older iPad.
My daughter wanted an iPad for Christmas & my heart just burst knowing I wouldn’t be able to afford  $600. I came across these refurbished iPads and decided to give it a go. When I received it I charged it and set it up just like a brand new iPad. Everything had been just like new so far. Very very very grateful for finding this!!! Thanks Beat Buy you made Christmas wishes come true
Very few downsides to this item. Especially for the price! I have never owned any apple products before purchasing this one, so this was a shot in the dark for me. And boy, did it hit the mark! The ipad is completely finctional, and has perfect sound and video quality. The only downside I could imagine, is that at times, it does lag, but very rarely does it do this. I chop this up to be it's age and not necessarily the hardware of the Ipad. Perfect for artists or those who just like a classic, and comfortable apple product to lounge with!
I love the refurbished IPad!  They are just like new, but a lot less expensive!!  And the customer experience is great with Best Buy. They are very helpful!
This is such a deal! It makes a great tablet just like the new ones in my opinion. This version is great to use as an AAC device for people that need communication assistance. iPad works with many of the AAC programs that droid tablets will not like TD snap. Makes it more affordable to people that need them!
She loving it be great for the price i’m trying to see what up get ￼ upgrades when needed also can upgrade to the new iPhone 15 ￼
The device is great and good condition. There are two scratches on the screen that are small but have a little light refraction. Is this to he expected frim a refurvished condution?
I loved it !!! It was brand new and clean. I will buy more from this place .
iPad arrived promptly and was in great condition.  Easy setup from older iPad. Purchased a couple for grandkids at our house.

It was excellent and works so well! I’m ordering another one!
No issues out of this iPad at all, works great for my daughter and she uses it everyday.
Loved it but wish it came in an ipad box so then it looks more professional, idk?
When I got that packaging was really good and there were no rips or damage. The iPad was in good condition when opened and it worked really well. Would purchase again.
Came in great condition. Received after market charger and plain cardboard box.
Bought this for my 6 year old daughter & she loved it. Definitely recommend & came in “like new” condition.
It is a perfect price for an ipad for my son.

Excellent performance so far!Good choice and highly recommend!
Great gift for my daughter and she was very excited about it
The item was as advertised and was delivered when promised. I have been using this iPad on the average of 8 hours a day and it has been functioning without a hitch. Price point was on the money, suffice to say I am a very happy with my purchase.
This was the best buy for my grand. Working well love it
I ordered two of these before Xmas.  No new ones were available.

It’s mid-February now, and both of them have failed.  One has minimal battery performance.  It takes too long to charge and doesn’t last but a few hours.  The other one’s screen touch is faulty.  About half of the screen is not responsive to touch.

I tried to talk with online support and they could offer no help but to tell me to go to the store.  It’s outside of the return policy, no warranty at all available or offered.

I think I’m stuck with about $600 worth of iPad turkeys.

I’m going to speak with store today, but they’re not obligated to help me.  Maybe I can find someone who will see the problem and help me, but it would have to be a manager who can make a human choice.
Love it it’s worth is good thanks best buddy best buy
Bought it for my brother daughter and it works great. Also is good for the price.
It’s refurbished and works fine. Much cheaper than new
