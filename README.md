This is the repo for my CS325 Project1.
The purpose is to use Phi3 and python to read from a file and get a response.

The follwing instructions are for Windows users
In order to do this project with my specifics you must:

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Create a GitHub for your project to save versions and save my files to yours in a folder
3. Now recreate my conda environment by first opening the terminal in VSCode in the Folder that GitHub is linked to
4. Then initailize conda by just typing conda in the terminal
5. Finally, type: conda create --name my_yaml_env --file requirement.yaml
    -my_yaml_env can be named anything you prefer for your environment
    -this installs all specific packages that I have.
6. Open sender.py and hit run!
    - you can have responses in the responsest.txt if you would like, but they will get overwrote every time that sender.py is ran.
