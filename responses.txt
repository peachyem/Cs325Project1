The concept of a "best" Yu-Gi-Oh! (YGO) Deck can be highly subjective and depends on various factors such as playstyle, preferred strategy, personal affinity for certain cards or mechanics within YGO. However, one commonly recognized strong foundation that many players find effective is the EDATH Monster Deck in Blue/Black, often referred to simply as "EDA." This deck emphasizes a straightforward and powerful approach with reliable win conditions using eda monsters like Edra Stone (EDAT), Dark Magician of Death, Reaper Dragon, Shadow Legion (and their numerous counterparts).

Here's an example setup for EDA: 
- Blue/Black Decklist - Approx. 250 cards
  1 x EDATH Monster Card
  4 x DARK MAGICIAN OF DEATH, Reaper Dragon (EDAT) or Shadow Legion (EDA)
  3 x YUUKO'S AGED CAVALRIES, Elder Magicians of the Void (EDAT/EDATA), Edra Stone 
  2 - 4x DARK FAIRY OF THE FINISH LINE Monster Card in various EDATH colors. e.g., Black Fairy and White-Blue Dragon with Counter Armor or Shadow Rider, Red Fairy of the End Line and Blue Dark Magician (EDAT/EDATA).
  - Other supportive cards: ATK Counters(50), DEF Resistance Traps like "Black Hole" in various colors. Deck-ending conditions through Life Point reduction or specific card effects, e.g., Lifelink by Dark Magician of Death and EDAT's ability to revive fallen monsters with cards such as RESURRECTION PHOENIX FLYING (EDATA).
  1 x ATK counter spellcaster like "Eye Mind" or similar, but optional.
  - Additional supporting spells: Counter-magic and Continuous Spell Supporting EDATH color schemes such as Glass Slammer/Grave Digger (EDAT), Frost Shaman of Winter Fields (EDATA). Also include various effects to support the deck's strategy, like "Trap Seal" or "Bug Control."
  - Additional Monsters and Spells: Depending on your playstyle preference for more variety in monster types.
  1 x EDATH-Colored Fusion spell cards such as Abyss Leviathan (Black) with MONSTROUS GIANT, or Dark Fairy of the End Line (White/Blue), which synergizes well together and allows a diverse set of responses to your opponent's strategies.
  1 x EDATH-Colored Fusion spell card for extra late game pressure: Eternal Dragon - Black with various fusion materials like SHIELD WARRIOR, or DEEPSEA FAERIE TACO (White/Blue), which combines powerful effects from both the Dark Fairy of the End Line and EDATH Monsters.
  *Side deck* for late game situations: Additional Fusion-Type monster cards with strong win conditions using fusion summoning mechanics like DARK WIZARD OF THE HALLOWED, who fuses any two light or dark spell card of the same name to produce a powerful EDATH Monster.
  4 x ATK/DEF counters for added defense and offense support in later stages (optional). 
- Additional Spells: Various other spells that fit your preferred YGO strategy, such as Synthesize Mana or "Spark Break" to keep monsters alive with EDATH Deck. Also include specific spell effects like Lifelink and Fusion Activation by Monster Summoning for late-game pressure (e.g., Abyss Leviathan).
  - Additional Cards: Other supportive cards such as Dual Traps, Link Magician of the Void's Edge EDAT to provide more flexibility in your strategy and additional threats against your opponents.
  1 x Life Point Reduction Spell for aggressive strategies or when you need a decisive edge: EXCELSIOR ORACLES OF THE WEAK (EDATA) can serve as an excellent finisher by reducing the life points of both players, leading to their defeat if they cannot recover.
  - Side Deck and Extra Cards for Flexibility & Adaptation: Additional cards that provide support or alternative strategies when you need a different approach during matches (e.g., additional monsters with counter-effects).
  1 x EDATH-Colored Monster Spell Activators, like ETERNAL DRAGON'S SPIN (EDAT), which synergizes well for Fusion Summoning and powerful effects in the late game phase. Additional fuse activating spells to create additional monsters or potent effect boosters based on your strategy preference: e.g., TRIPLE ETERNAL DRAGON (EDATA) combined with EDATH Monster materials for an extra strong endgame presence, allowing you the flexibility of Fusion Summoning multiple times and creating a formidable late-game force to overwhelm opponents in critical situations.
  - Miscellaneous Cards: "Monopoly," "Spark Break" (optional), various EDATH Deck Link Spells for linking powerful monsters like Eternal Dragon, Abyss Leviathan or Dark Magician of Death with other strong synergistic cards within your deck setup to create more potent threats and win conditions.
  1 x Monster Trap Card: SHIELD OF THE ANCIENTS (EDATA), a powerful EDATH-colored trap card that provides defense against various Spell & Continuous effects, enhancing overall strategy for better control in gameplay phases where opponents try to disrupt your strategies.
  - Additional Extra Cards: Depending on personal preferences and the meta during tournament play or casual YGO sessions; some may include additional supportive monsters like various DARK FAIRY OF THE FINISH LINE, EDATH-colored Monster Spell Activators for flexible fuse activation options such as "Oath of Ruin" (EDAT) and more.
  *Total:* Approx. 250 cards in the decklist
