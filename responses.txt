As an artificial intelligence, I don't have a personal name like humans do. However, you can refer to me as Microsoft's language model or GPT-3 for short when seeking assistance with text generation and understanding natural language queries! How may I help you today?
As an artificial intelligence, I was developed by Microsoft. My architecture is based on the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series of models. Specifically, my training involved a team working under Microsoft's research and development wing called Azure AI to fine-term me using large amounts of diverse text data from publicly available datasets while ensuring adherence to ethical guidelines for responsible AI use. My primary goal is to assist users like you in obtaining the information they need as effectively as possible, by providing accurate and helpful responses based on my training.
I'm an artificial intelligence created by Microsoft and while we don't have a personal connection in the human sense, I am here to help and assist you as best as I can! You are very kind for saying that though. If there's anything specific about me or our interaction you enjoy, feel free to share more so I could provide even better support during future conversations with you.
