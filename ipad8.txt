Would give it five stars but was not as advertised 
Did not come with charger or power adapter 
Like it shows on the photo,item was in good condition
Perfect the only thing that didn’t liked was the cable and the charger wasn’t the original and did not came with the pen as promised but was none scratched at all
Over all this was a great purchase. I am completely satisfied with my iPad. Everything is as it was advertised and works very good.
Arrived earlier than expected and is working good! Charger was included.
Beautiful iPad, no scratches or marks. Runs great, has good charge, and my son loves it!!!
My daughter absolutely love this iPad. Even though it was refurbish, everyone thinks it’s the newest generation. This is her favorite bday gift.
iPad had the charger with box but iPad had sticker + glue residue on back. Charger was dirty . Looks like someone just switched their charger . 
Besides that tablet works fine . No scratches or marks. 

If it wasn’t for the left over residue it would’ve got 5 stars bc this one actually came with a charger box compare to the other iPad I bought with this one that only came with the charger wire
The iPad was delivered quickly and is exactly as described. My daughter absolutely loves it
I knew the ipad would come with scratches, since it is refurbished. But I was unaware it would come with dents and screen damage. There is a ring around the screen and lines in the screen show when watching videos. I also don’t think the screen is a genuine Apple screen. It seems very low quality and the quality of the camera is also very low. This feels more like an android tablet than an Ipad
This one came with bubble wrap and nicely put with a charger but no power box & the box it came with wasn’t sealed . Besides that iPad came with no scratches or cracks and works .

I got 2 refurbished iPads and this one was better then the other . The other had the charger with box but was not cleaned correctly. It had some sticker + glue residue on back. Charger was dirty . iPad works fine tho . Will update review in a month
I have been wanting an iPad. They were having a good sale so glad I got the alert through the app. Couldn’t wait to open it. I love it. I use it daily, would definitely recommend.
I've never bought a refurbished item before, so I was a little hesitant; however, the price was reasonable, and I decided to go for it. It arrived fine—no scratches or marks. It works as any ole' iPad except it takes a long time to charge. Not sure if it's because it's an older generation or if it's because it's refurbished. Despite that being a smidge annoying, it's nothing I can't deal with. I just know to charge it well in advance if I need it at full battery for the day (:
Purchased this as a gift for a family member. Great deal and the iPad was in perfect working condition. I've purchased several refurbished items from Best Buy and will continue to do so!
The ipad is in perfect condition. There is not any blemishes in the cosmetic appearance.  Works flawlessly
While we were excited to get this Tablet (Refurbished) there is some disappointment. It was a Holiday Gift and it was not available in new condition for delivery prior to Christmas. The Unit functions quite well but it did not come with a user guide or a box. To be clear no complaints about the actual tablet but I don't know if I would buy a refurb again unless it was for myself
Came in an excellent review my boyfriend loved it. There a few scratches on the back and it chipped at the top but not noticeable with the case on. The charger that came with it is a Best Buy brand.
Works like new, no issues and worth the price.. my Mom loves it.
Ipad was in very good condition. I'm not tech savvy so I got locked out of the Pad. Geek Squad got me back in
Seems to be working, though I haven't used it too much yet. It did not come with a charger block, but that was rectified by my local store.
Got the ipad for my daughter, she loves it. Quickly realised storage space is not that much. Its crazy that apple and retailers sell ipads and such with 32GB or less storage. I know its cheaper but dont they make enough money. Overall great ipad!
Beautiful fully functional iPad for penny’s on the dollar! Great customer service…I highly recommend!
10 out of 10!
Product exactly like advertised. No issues so far except the 50 character minimum in this review
Came in great shape, my 4th iPad from BB and will keep buying from them!
Came in good shape, no scratches or anything.  Charger was included.  Working as expected so far.
Good stuff.   iPad is just like new.  Skeptical at first, but it’s great
It’s kinda scratched up but I guess that’s cuz it’s refurbished? Besides that, it’s great.
The device exceeded my expectations with its like-new condition and reliable performance. The gold finish adds a touch of elegance, and the 32GB storage provides ample space for apps and files. Considering the cost savings of a certified refurb, it's a fantastic value without compromising on quality. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a budget-friendly yet high-quality iPad experience.
I love it dropped it like twice but no problem at all took long to update and everything but other than that perfect
I received the product in perfect condition and functional
The geek squad member was gery knowledgeable and solved my issue immediately
Made this iPad purchase for my daughter. She loves it. Great first electronic device. Chose this over a cell phone because she uses this for school.
Great condition!! I’m giving it as a christmas present and i can’t wait to see my sister’s reaction!!!
It’s Great don’t have good memory , also it freezes every now and then but it’s a ok product.
Honestly for the past 2 months I've had it, I've come across no issues. The biggest issue I had was, it was very poorly packaged and they gave the wrong charger (they gave a USB-C when I needed lightning) but, other than that, it works wonderfully and I would heavily recommend if you don't mind buying another charger.
I really enjoy this device. I have had no problems whatsoever with it and it works so well.
iPad works great. It came with a few dents on the back and the screen was chipped a bit at the top but nothing too major. The Touch ID doesn’t work very well so I’m not really able to use it. Not a big deal. Everything else works perfect.
Excellent price.. excellent product.  Happy to add another iPad for occasional use. No problems sharing
This works wonderfully.  I am very pleased with the quality of this refurbished iPad.  Loved the price.
I’m satisfied only thing didn’t come with a charger.
Works great. Love it for school and play.  I would have never known it was previously used
