Good for college note taking and casual games. Had an iPad 2 back in the day and it’s nostalgic. The only issue I have with it is that it charges kind of slow, but it does hold that charge for quite a bit. I could go to classes all day on 30-40% and be okay. It shouldn’t be an issue unless you’re intensely gaming on it or streaming for more than a few hours (and at that point you should stop and take a break anyway!). Display I rate at 4 stars because clearly it’s not as great as the OLED models but no matter what sunshine is it’s worst enemy.
I’ve been using the 10.2-Inch iPad (9th Generation) for a few days, and it has been excellent for both personal and professional use. The 64GB storage provides enough space for my apps, photos, and occasional downloads, and the performance is smooth and responsive for multitasking.

The Retina display is sharp and bright, which makes watching videos or browsing the web enjoyable. Plus, the battery life easily lasts me through the day. The classic Space Gray color looks sleek and professional, too.

Overall, this iPad is a fantastic option if you need a reliable, budget-friendly device for everyday tasks. Highly recommend!
Overall very happy with this purchase! Works perfectly and I got it for a great price. I’m using it for my graduate program and it’s so convenient to take with me to class and pull out to reference an article. The iPad holds a charge for a long time and I can easily tether it to my phone via hotspot just from the iPad. I literally use this every day
I am absolutely thrilled with my Apple 10.2-Inch iPad (9th Generation) with Wi-Fi in Silver! This device has truly exceeded my expectations in every aspect, especially when it comes to productivity and note-taking.

First and foremost, the iPad's seamless integration with Office365 has been a game-changer for my work routine. Whether I'm drafting documents, creating spreadsheets, or preparing presentations, having access to the full suite of Office apps on this sleek device has made my workflow incredibly efficient. The responsive touchscreen and intuitive interface make tasks feel effortless, allowing me to focus more on the content rather than wrestling with technology.

One of the standout features for me is the versatility of the iPad when it comes to note-taking. Whether I'm in a meeting, lecture, or brainstorming session, the iPad's Apple Pencil compatibility combined with its spacious 10.2-inch screen provides the perfect canvas for jotting down ideas, sketching diagrams, or annotating documents with precision. The palm rejection technology ensures a natural writing experience without any frustrating interruptions.

Moreover, the 64GB storage capacity ensures that I have more than enough space to store my documents, presentations, notes, and multimedia files without worrying about running out of storage. The iPad's seamless synchronization with iCloud also ensures that my files are securely backed up and accessible across all my Apple devices, adding an extra layer of convenience to my work life.

In addition to its exceptional performance for work-related tasks, the iPad is also a joy to use for entertainment and leisure activities. Whether I'm streaming movies, browsing the web, or playing games, the vibrant Retina display and powerful A13 Bionic chip deliver a stunning visual experience that never fails to impress.

Overall, I cannot recommend the Apple 10.2-Inch iPad (9th Generation) enough for anyone in need of a reliable, versatile, and powerful device for work and beyond. Its seamless integration with Office365, impeccable note-taking capabilities, ample storage, and stunning performance make it a must-have tool for professionals and students alike.
Best IPad i have had in years I am really enjoying it the price was right for me, I definitely needed a better IPad mine was really old and it had only 16 gigs and I couldn’t download anything, cause it was so old the new apps  were not compatible to this iPad, I am on a budget and the price was in my budget I only paid 270.00 for a brand new 10.2 inch  IPad with 64 gigs I have downloaded a lot of great apps that I could not download on my old IPad, I am so happy I bought this IPad! I just can’t stop playing my games on it! I highly recommend this IPad! I Love it! Thanks Best Buy! You ROCK!
Why did I buy this iPad?
- I’m a student, and I need a device for study and entertainment.
- I’m managing a social media page for an organization so I can use the iPad to do that.

Advantages:
- For study and work
                    + This iPad is really fast and reliable 
                    + Taking notes and outlining ideas is very convenient.
                    + With Apple Pencil and Logitech combo touch, this iPad is more and more useful.
- For entertainment and other purposes
                    + The display is clear and bright.
                    + Speakers are good.
                    + The very light weight that helps I can hold for a long time without any difficulty.
                    + Touch ID is fast and reliable.
                    + Fast charging and it may take around 1 hour not too long.

- Disadvantages
                    + Display color is a little bland compared to the iPad with my iPhone and my Macbook. This point has not affected my experience but if you have any works with color, I think you should consider other models.
                   + With the keyboard and cover it will be a little heavier. 
                   + The new iPad OS isn’t stable right now, Safari sometimes crashes.
                   + The trackpad of the Logitech cover sometimes freezes, I think it is because of the new OS but I’m not sure.
                   + The non-laminated display is not beautiful like the Mini, Air, or Pro models. To be honest, I can’t realize if they are not side by side but I want to mention it because it may help you to make your decision.

Summary 
With $250.00 this iPad has a good price/performance

sleek/light great product for my daughter to advance with her technology skills and it's very easy to use and with the accessories like the keyboard or stylus pen make the ipad even more fun for myself to use.

its great for movies, games, learning applications for my growing five year old, doing class related college work or just for music. 

I wish it could somehow charge via bluetooth or charging dock make it easier for my child to charge for later use.

i am very pleased with the power use time and storage space and also the ability to make calls via wifi, my child really likes this feature the most 

this is a great product i am glad to have purchased one now, should have gotten this instead of a tablet and i am very happy with the overall functionality 

its like having a really big iphone minus the data and phone usage
Love it. Was so easy to set up as it took all the apps and settings off my iPhone. I don't live off my iPad and iPhone like most as I prefer to be on my mac mini and large screen/keyboard, but I do love being able to take and make calls as well from this iPad (using my cell service so no cost for an extra line). I use a cheap $1 stand on my desk's upper shelf and it makes calling to places that you know there's gonna be a long hold much easier, as well as face timing with my grandson. Sound is great, clear and loud enough. Until I can get a new case with a keyboard (it's a bit taller than my old iPad), my old iPad keyboard (like 14-yrs) still paired nicely, so that's great for when I'm not in my office. Battery also lasts a long time. While it's always on, I mostly use during the evenings while watching TV and such, so my battery is lasting 3 days.
loveee my ipad!!i’ve been wanting this iPad for monthssss n i finally got it and i’m so inlove w it!!perfect size to binge netflix n hulu alllll weekend. this is the best iPad you can get right now because it can do everything the newer gens can do in terms of casual use but soooo much cheaper anddd it’s still pretty new so it’s gonna continue to get the newest software updates for the next couple years!!

Great price, really nice display. Kids love there their tablets, could use a little more memory for games but cannot beat the price
One evening I saw on Best Buy’s website, an 
I-pad gen 9 that I’ve been shopping for. The  price was better than Target’s or Walmarts for the same item . In the morning I went to the Best Buy store located in Jensen Beach .I went to the department withe iPads, there a female employee greeted me and offered her assistance.She was very knowledgeable and friendly ., I also inquired to her about buying a keyboard for the iPad., Thanks to her help, I decided to purchase both, the Apple iPad and the Zagg keyboard. Once I got home I saw the employee was right, setting up the iPad was easy. I like the fact that it has a bright screen and comes with apps pre installed that I’d be using . Two days later my Zagg keyboard was delivered,just as she told me it would be, again an easy setup. I’m very happy with both purchases . When you invest hard earned money into a product it’s a very satisfying feeling knowing your money was well spent, Thank you Best Buy, with out your friendly and smart employee I might not of made the two purchases. Best Buy will continue to have my business for all my electronic needs in the future.
I recently got my hands on the Apple 10.2-Inch iPad (9th Generation) in Silver, and I have to say, it’s a fantastic device for anyone looking for a reliable tablet without breaking the bank.

First off, the performance is impressive! Thanks to the A13 Bionic chip, everything runs smoothly—whether I’m browsing the web, streaming my favorite shows, or playing a casual game. The 10.2-inch Retina display is a joy to use; it’s bright and vibrant, making reading or watching videos really enjoyable.

The 64GB of storage is decent for everyday use. I’ve been able to store plenty of apps and a good number of photos without any issues. But if you tend to save a lot of videos or large files, you might want to consider going for a model with more storage.

What I love most about this iPad is its versatility. It's compatible with the Apple Pencil (1st generation) and the Smart Keyboard, so it’s perfect for jotting down notes, sketching, or even tackling some light work tasks. It really transforms the iPad into a mini workstation, which is super handy for students and professionals alike.

In terms of design, it has that classic Apple look with sleek aluminum and slim bezels, though it might feel a bit old-school compared to the newer models. But honestly, it’s still a solid, durable device that feels great in hand.

Overall, the 9th generation iPad is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for an all-around tablet. Whether you’re a student, a casual user, or someone who just wants a reliable device for streaming and browsing, this iPad has got you covered!
Great price for a great iPad!! I use it every day!! It’s even cheaper now.
Love this iPad; it has great storage and can do everything you need it to. Plus, it lasts a long time.
Worth every penny! I bought this with the intentions of having another piece of technology. But it is really a work of art. You can use it for movies, taking notes, editing, work, almost anything on a perfect sized screen. It’s fast, it stays charges for days, and can fit into a lot of places. The performance is excellent. Worth every penny.
Perfect for my needs. I can watch YouTube tv, browse the Internet, all apps and functions work very quickly. It’s the perfect size to carry with me when I travel. Battery life is great. I have nothing negative to say about this purchase.
Of all the iPads that came out in 2022, this is by far the most bang for the buck. It has the feature where the front-facing camera follows you for FaceTime calls, Zoom, etc. It also comes with the fast charger (USB-C on the plug end). It now starts @ 64GB of memory (which is plenty for me) & has TruTone display (really nice feature).

At $329 (you can get it for $299 on sale), you can't beat it. The other iPads seem to be so overpriced for the small difference in performance / features. 

I would say the only negative is that the speakers aren't the greatest on this IPad, but honestly I either use my bluetooth headphones or a Bose bluetooth speaker, which makes that a non-issue.

BestBuy in Cuyahoga Falls was a great help getting this IPad for me along with an Otterbox Defender Pro case. A perfect combination...

Bought this for school and works incredibly well for the price. It’s durable, easy to work with, and battery life lasts atleast 1-2 days despite working hours with it. I wanted to get the 9th gen because of the home button as well as the price point. If your looking to get one for school, this one works good enough!
This ipad was a gift for my child at Christmas. Everything was seamless - from ordering to delivery. The device itself has great battery life, a wonferful screen resolution, and can reach loud volumes. Overall, this is a great ipad for the price!
This worked perfect for the need it was purchased for. 79 yr old mother wanted to be able to sit in her recliner while on computer. She has really enjoyed the ease of using her new Ipad. Storage and speed plenty adequate. Great purchase and price was great. The size was perfect. The sound and volume works great for her. Charging is fast and easy. It was really easy to set up. And the useability was easy enough for a 79 year old to use. I would definitely purchase again according to the product and the business (Best Buy). They were helpful in making my decision and answering all questions i had concering the different generations of Ipads. It was a Mothers Day gift from me , my brother and sister.
I bought this when it was on sale so at discounted price I think the tablet is a good deal.   I use iPhone so having an iPad helps me streamline my work, apps, email and social media.  Screen is not as high quality as the Air and Pro version but still better than other brand.  It’s bright, sharp and better viewing angle.  Screen is gorilla glass but I won’t count on it, it is still scratchable if not careful.  The sound quality is acceptable, wish it that it could be louder.  Battery life is excellent t, I can use this for 4-5hrs before charging.  It comes with Apple lightning cable and 20w charger, even new iPhone doesn’t come with charger any more.  I might need so buy another one for myself as my kids are currently taking over this one.  For durability, I always keep this tablet in a hard case to protect it.
The Apple iPad is a fantastic device with several standout features. It boasts quick performance, ensuring smooth multitasking and app usage. The battery life is impressive, allowing for extended use without frequent recharging. Its lightweight design makes it convenient to carry around. The screen is beautiful, offering vibrant colors and sharp resolution. For users like me who rely on the Google Suite, it effectively replaces the need for a laptop, making it a versatile tool for both work and entertainment.
I recently purchased the iPad 9th generation from Best Buy, and I couldn’t be happier with my experience! The entire process, from browsing to checkout, was smooth and straightforward. The iPad arrived promptly and in perfect condition. As someone who values quality and efficiency, I’m thoroughly impressed with how well this device performs—whether it’s for browsing, streaming, or productivity, it handles everything seamlessly. Not only did I get a fantastic device at an unbeatable price, but the exceptional customer service and speedy delivery made the experience even better. Thank you, Best Buy, for making this purchase a joy! I highly recommend Best Buy to anyone considering an upgrade to their tech collection.”
I am very happy with my purchase and very good price. Came without any damage and set up went smoothly. I miss my previous Ipad, however, I got another one and im happy. Thank you!!
I am thrilled with this iPad. I'm one of those people who likes to get a generation or two older than whatever the newest product is because it's a much better bargain and they work just fine. I bought this mainly to link up to my exercise equipment so I could run iFIT programs, and it is absolutely perfect. It Bluetooths perfectly with my equipment and is colorful and fast. I've had no negative issues with it at all, and it was easy to set up. It's also great to take with me for traveling. Very lightweight. I bought a cover for better protection and to make sure the screen will be turned off. Very happy with this purchase!
I needed an iPad for work and the price and function of the 9th generation was perfect for the job. The battery life of the device make it an amazing companion for my Mac Pro.
My husband has had it since Christmas when I bought it for him and he absolutely LOVES it!!! Links with your iPhone so you can text, FaceTime, etc off the tablet connected to your phone. We love it!!! Would 10000% recommend it! Haven’t charged it in 6 days and on it everyday!
Item is just what my husband needed to maintain his business invoices and records. Easy to use and storage is definitely a plus
Exactly what I need and the screen and image is Crystal clear. This just lets me know the new models are also worth it. A great starter iPad at a great price. No speed issues either, and battery lasts a few days with streaming and consistent use.
My iPad works really good, I’m very happy with my purchase, I use it all day at school so you know my battery run good , I haven’t had any difficulty with this iPad I say buy it while you can definitely worth the price.
My purchase was a Apple - 10.2-Inch iPad with Wi-Fi - 64GB. I bought my iPad for use when traveling to for movies and book as the reviews were bery positive for the picture and sound quality! I wanted a multi function device so went with the apple ipad. It was very easy to set up and program with my other apple products easily.  I am very impressed with the clearness amd sharpness of the graphics when watching movies and watching videos! I would recommend this product.
I love my Ipad. Ive had it for months and I use it for everything! Routines, recepies, school work, reading, etc … I even use it to find my phone when I lose it. 
I drew a beautiful portrait for my husband and it was all thanks to this because I wouldn’t have been able to myself on paper. Has great life battery and I love that I receive my calls on here too. 12/10
Does its job. Great battery life. Amazing price. Can’t ask for anything more
This iPad is amazing!! It’s such a steal compared to the other Ipad costs through Apple and seems very durable and the battery life is super good! I’ve used it for at least 9 hours without the battery dying. I love the size of this product too. I thought it was possibly going to feel too big but it’s perfect. I personally mostly use this iPad for my digital planner and use a stylus pen with it. It’s perfect for digital planner and the overall user experience is solid! More like the iPhone, I do wish there was an on/off switch for sound.
It's still worth buying this old device in 2024 if you don't have much heavy-duty work on an iPad. Mine is just for my son's online study, so 64G is enough for us. Excellent!!
This is a great item to have at home for all purposes of multimedia. While me or my wife watch TV at home, one of us can pick up the tablet and watch a separate channel or game, or any multimedia type tasks. It’s great for on the road or at work breaks. Works great, no errors, and last long battery wise.
