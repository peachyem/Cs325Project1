Good for college note taking and casual games. Had an iPad 2 back in the day and it’s nostalgic. The only issue I have with it is that it charges kind of slow, but it does hold that charge for quite a bit. I could go to classes all day on 30-40% and be okay. It shouldn’t be an issue unless you’re intensely gaming on it or streaming for more than a few hours (and at that point you should stop and take a break anyway!). Display I rate at 4 stars because clearly it’s not as great as the OLED models but no matter what sunshine is it’s worst enemy.
Overall very happy with this purchase! Works perfectly and I got it for a great price. I’m using it for my graduate program and it’s so convenient to take with me to class and pull out to reference an article. The iPad holds a charge for a long time and I can easily tether it to my phone via hotspot just from the iPad. I literally use this every day
I am absolutely thrilled with my Apple 10.2-Inch iPad (9th Generation) with Wi-Fi in Silver! This device has truly exceeded my expectations in every aspect, especially when it comes to productivity and note-taking.

First and foremost, the iPad's seamless integration with Office365 has been a game-changer for my work routine. Whether I'm drafting documents, creating spreadsheets, or preparing presentations, having access to the full suite of Office apps on this sleek device has made my workflow incredibly efficient. The responsive touchscreen and intuitive interface make tasks feel effortless, allowing me to focus more on the content rather than wrestling with technology.

One of the standout features for me is the versatility of the iPad when it comes to note-taking. Whether I'm in a meeting, lecture, or brainstorming session, the iPad's Apple Pencil compatibility combined with its spacious 10.2-inch screen provides the perfect canvas for jotting down ideas, sketching diagrams, or annotating documents with precision. The palm rejection technology ensures a natural writing experience without any frustrating interruptions.

Moreover, the 64GB storage capacity ensures that I have more than enough space to store my documents, presentations, notes, and multimedia files without worrying about running out of storage. The iPad's seamless synchronization with iCloud also ensures that my files are securely backed up and accessible across all my Apple devices, adding an extra layer of convenience to my work life.

In addition to its exceptional performance for work-related tasks, the iPad is also a joy to use for entertainment and leisure activities. Whether I'm streaming movies, browsing the web, or playing games, the vibrant Retina display and powerful A13 Bionic chip deliver a stunning visual experience that never fails to impress.

Overall, I cannot recommend the Apple 10.2-Inch iPad (9th Generation) enough for anyone in need of a reliable, versatile, and powerful device for work and beyond. Its seamless integration with Office365, impeccable note-taking capabilities, ample storage, and stunning performance make it a must-have tool for professionals and students alike.
Best IPad i have had in years I am really enjoying it the price was right for me, I definitely needed a better IPad mine was really old and it had only 16 gigs and I couldn’t download anything, cause it was so old the new apps  were not compatible to this iPad, I am on a budget and the price was in my budget I only paid 270.00 for a brand new 10.2 inch  IPad with 64 gigs I have downloaded a lot of great apps that I could not download on my old IPad, I am so happy I bought this IPad! I just can’t stop playing my games on it! I highly recommend this IPad! I Love it! Thanks Best Buy! You ROCK!
Why did I buy this iPad?
- I’m a student, and I need a device for study and entertainment.
- I’m managing a social media page for an organization so I can use the iPad to do that.

Advantages:
- For study and work
                    + This iPad is really fast and reliable 
                    + Taking notes and outlining ideas is very convenient.
                    + With Apple Pencil and Logitech combo touch, this iPad is more and more useful.
- For entertainment and other purposes
                    + The display is clear and bright.
                    + Speakers are good.
                    + The very light weight that helps I can hold for a long time without any difficulty.
                    + Touch ID is fast and reliable.
                    + Fast charging and it may take around 1 hour not too long.

- Disadvantages
                    + Display color is a little bland compared to the iPad with my iPhone and my Macbook. This point has not affected my experience but if you have any works with color, I think you should consider other models.
                   + With the keyboard and cover it will be a little heavier. 
                   + The new iPad OS isn’t stable right now, Safari sometimes crashes.
                   + The trackpad of the Logitech cover sometimes freezes, I think it is because of the new OS but I’m not sure.
                   + The non-laminated display is not beautiful like the Mini, Air, or Pro models. To be honest, I can’t realize if they are not side by side but I want to mention it because it may help you to make your decision.

Summary 
With $250.00 this iPad has a good price/performance

Thank you for reading my iPad 9th experience :)
sleek/light great product for my daughter to advance with her technology skills and it's very easy to use and with the accessories like the keyboard or stylus pen make the ipad even more fun for myself to use.

its great for movies, games, learning applications for my growing five year old, doing class related college work or just for music. 

I wish it could somehow charge via bluetooth or charging dock make it easier for my child to charge for later use.

i am very pleased with the power use time and storage space and also the ability to make calls via wifi, my child really likes this feature the most 

this is a great product i am glad to have purchased one now, should have gotten this instead of a tablet and i am very happy with the overall functionality 

its like having a really big iphone minus the data and phone usage

loveee my ipad!!i’ve been wanting this iPad for monthssss n i finally got it and i’m so inlove w it!!perfect size to binge netflix n hulu alllll weekend. this is the best iPad you can get right now because it can do everything the newer gens can do in terms of casual use but soooo much cheaper anddd it’s still pretty new so it’s gonna continue to get the newest software updates for the next couple years!!
Love it. Was so easy to set up as it took all the apps and settings off my iPhone. I don't live off my iPad and iPhone like most as I prefer to be on my mac mini and large screen/keyboard, but I do love being able to take and make calls as well from this iPad (using my cell service so no cost for an extra line). I use a cheap $1 stand on my desk's upper shelf and it makes calling to places that you know there's gonna be a long hold much easier, as well as face timing with my grandson. Sound is great, clear and loud enough. Until I can get a new case with a keyboard (it's a bit taller than my old iPad), my old iPad keyboard (like 14-yrs) still paired nicely, so that's great for when I'm not in my office. Battery also lasts a long time. While it's always on, I mostly use during the evenings while watching TV and such, so my battery is lasting 3 days.
One evening I saw on Best Buy’s website, an 
I-pad gen 9 that I’ve been shopping for. The  price was better than Target’s or Walmarts for the same item . In the morning I went to the Best Buy store located in Jensen Beach .I went to the department withe iPads, there a female employee greeted me and offered her assistance.She was very knowledgeable and friendly ., I also inquired to her about buying a keyboard for the iPad., Thanks to her help, I decided to purchase both, the Apple iPad and the Zagg keyboard. Once I got home I saw the employee was right, setting up the iPad was easy. I like the fact that it has a bright screen and comes with apps pre installed that I’d be using . Two days later my Zagg keyboard was delivered,just as she told me it would be, again an easy setup. I’m very happy with both purchases . When you invest hard earned money into a product it’s a very satisfying feeling knowing your money was well spent, Thank you Best Buy, with out your friendly and smart employee I might not of made the two purchases. Best Buy will continue to have my business for all my electronic needs in the future.
I recently got my hands on the Apple 10.2-Inch iPad (9th Generation) in Silver, and I have to say, it’s a fantastic device for anyone looking for a reliable tablet without breaking the bank.

First off, the performance is impressive! Thanks to the A13 Bionic chip, everything runs smoothly—whether I’m browsing the web, streaming my favorite shows, or playing a casual game. The 10.2-inch Retina display is a joy to use; it’s bright and vibrant, making reading or watching videos really enjoyable.

The 64GB of storage is decent for everyday use. I’ve been able to store plenty of apps and a good number of photos without any issues. But if you tend to save a lot of videos or large files, you might want to consider going for a model with more storage.

What I love most about this iPad is its versatility. It's compatible with the Apple Pencil (1st generation) and the Smart Keyboard, so it’s perfect for jotting down notes, sketching, or even tackling some light work tasks. It really transforms the iPad into a mini workstation, which is super handy for students and professionals alike.

In terms of design, it has that classic Apple look with sleek aluminum and slim bezels, though it might feel a bit old-school compared to the newer models. But honestly, it’s still a solid, durable device that feels great in hand.

Overall, the 9th generation iPad is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for an all-around tablet. Whether you’re a student, a casual user, or someone who just wants a reliable device for streaming and browsing, this iPad has got you covered!
Worth every penny! I bought this with the intentions of having another piece of technology. But it is really a work of art. You can use it for movies, taking notes, editing, work, almost anything on a perfect sized screen. It’s fast, it stays charges for days, and can fit into a lot of places. The performance is excellent. Worth every penny.
Love this iPad; it has great storage and can do everything you need it to. Plus, it lasts a long time.
Of all the iPads that came out in 2022, this is by far the most bang for the buck. It has the feature where the front-facing camera follows you for FaceTime calls, Zoom, etc. It also comes with the fast charger (USB-C on the plug end). It now starts @ 64GB of memory (which is plenty for me) & has TruTone display (really nice feature).

At $329 (you can get it for $299 on sale), you can't beat it. The other iPads seem to be so overpriced for the small difference in performance / features. 

I would say the only negative is that the speakers aren't the greatest on this IPad, but honestly I either use my bluetooth headphones or a Bose bluetooth speaker, which makes that a non-issue.

BestBuy in Cuyahoga Falls was a great help getting this IPad for me along with an Otterbox Defender Pro case. A perfect combination...
I recently purchased the Apple iPad and have been thoroughly impressed with its performance and versatility. The device seamlessly integrates into my daily routine, offering a sleek design and a user-friendly interface.

Pros:

Powerful Performance: The iPad delivers a smooth and responsive experience, whether I'm multitasking, streaming videos, or running demanding applications.

Stunning Display: The high-resolution Retina display provides vibrant colors and sharp details, making it a delight to consume various types of content, from movies to digital art.

Long Battery Life: The battery life is excellent, allowing me to use the iPad for an extended period without constantly worrying about recharging.

Quality Build: Apple's commitment to craftsmanship is evident in the iPad's build quality. It feels sturdy and premium, enhancing the overall user experience.

Wide Range of Apps: The App Store offers a vast selection of apps tailored for the iPad, catering to productivity, creativity, and entertainment needs.

Cons:

Price: While the iPad undoubtedly offers value for its features, the price point might be a consideration for budget-conscious consumers.

Storage Options: Depending on your usage, the entry-level storage might feel limiting, especially if you plan to store a significant amount of media or large applications.

Overall Impression:

The Apple iPad exceeds expectations in terms of performance and usability. It's a versatile device suitable for work, entertainment, and creativity. While the price may be a deterrent for some, the investment is justified by the quality and seamless integration into the Apple ecosystem. Highly recommended for those seeking a premium tablet experience.
The iPad 9 is a remarkable device that seamlessly combines sleek design with powerful performance. Its vivid display and responsive touch make every interaction a delight, while the robust processing capabilities ensure smooth multitasking and an overall exceptional user experience. The versatility of the iPad 9, whether for work or entertainment, truly sets it apart. I highly appreciate its reliability, making it a top choice for anyone seeking a cutting-edge tablet. Choosing the iPad 9 is not just a purchase; it's an investment in quality and innovation. Best Buy's survey is an excellent opportunity to acknowledge the excellence of this device, and I'm thrilled to share my positive experience.
Bought this for school and works incredibly well for the price. It’s durable, easy to work with, and battery life lasts atleast 1-2 days despite working hours with it. I wanted to get the 9th gen because of the home button as well as the price point. If your looking to get one for school, this one works good enough!
The Apple iPad is a fantastic device with several standout features. It boasts quick performance, ensuring smooth multitasking and app usage. The battery life is impressive, allowing for extended use without frequent recharging. Its lightweight design makes it convenient to carry around. The screen is beautiful, offering vibrant colors and sharp resolution. For users like me who rely on the Google Suite, it effectively replaces the need for a laptop, making it a versatile tool for both work and entertainment.
This worked perfect for the need it was purchased for. 79 yr old mother wanted to be able to sit in her recliner while on computer. She has really enjoyed the ease of using her new Ipad. Storage and speed plenty adequate. Great purchase and price was great. The size was perfect. The sound and volume works great for her. Charging is fast and easy. It was really easy to set up. And the useability was easy enough for a 79 year old to use. I would definitely purchase again according to the product and the business (Best Buy). They were helpful in making my decision and answering all questions i had concering the different generations of Ipads. It was a Mothers Day gift from me , my brother and sister.
My iPad works really good, I’m very happy with my purchase, I use it all day at school so you know my battery run good , I haven’t had any difficulty with this iPad I say buy it while you can definitely worth the price.
My husband has had it since Christmas when I bought it for him and he absolutely LOVES it!!! Links with your iPhone so you can text, FaceTime, etc off the tablet connected to your phone. We love it!!! Would 10000% recommend it! Haven’t charged it in 6 days and on it everyday!
Item is just what my husband needed to maintain his business invoices and records. Easy to use and storage is definitely a plus
This ipad was a gift for my child at Christmas. Everything was seamless - from ordering to delivery. The device itself has great battery life, a wonferful screen resolution, and can reach loud volumes. Overall, this is a great ipad for the price!
I bought this when it was on sale so at discounted price I think the tablet is a good deal.   I use iPhone so having an iPad helps me streamline my work, apps, email and social media.  Screen is not as high quality as the Air and Pro version but still better than other brand.  It’s bright, sharp and better viewing angle.  Screen is gorilla glass but I won’t count on it, it is still scratchable if not careful.  The sound quality is acceptable, wish it that it could be louder.  Battery life is excellent t, I can use this for 4-5hrs before charging.  It comes with Apple lightning cable and 20w charger, even new iPhone doesn’t come with charger any more.  I might need so buy another one for myself as my kids are currently taking over this one.  For durability, I always keep this tablet in a hard case to protect it.
I needed an iPad for work and the price and function of the 9th generation was perfect for the job. The battery life of the device make it an amazing companion for my Mac Pro.
Exactly what I need and the screen and image is Crystal clear. This just lets me know the new models are also worth it. A great starter iPad at a great price. No speed issues either, and battery lasts a few days with streaming and consistent use.
It's still worth buying this old device in 2024 if you don't have much heavy-duty work on an iPad. Mine is just for my son's online study, so 64G is enough for us. Excellent!!
Does its job. Great battery life. Amazing price. Can’t ask for anything more
I got a great deal on this and my daughter loves it. It was for her birthday and she was super excited when she got it everything worked perfectly. I takes long to die and this girl is always on tik tok
This is a great item to have at home for all purposes of multimedia. While me or my wife watch TV at home, one of us can pick up the tablet and watch a separate channel or game, or any multimedia type tasks. It’s great for on the road or at work breaks. Works great, no errors, and last long battery wise.
My purchase was a Apple - 10.2-Inch iPad with Wi-Fi - 64GB. I bought my iPad for use when traveling to for movies and book as the reviews were bery positive for the picture and sound quality! I wanted a multi function device so went with the apple ipad. It was very easy to set up and program with my other apple products easily.  I am very impressed with the clearness amd sharpness of the graphics when watching movies and watching videos! I would recommend this product.
This iPad is amazing!! It’s such a steal compared to the other Ipad costs through Apple and seems very durable and the battery life is super good! I’ve used it for at least 9 hours without the battery dying. I love the size of this product too. I thought it was possibly going to feel too big but it’s perfect. I personally mostly use this iPad for my digital planner and use a stylus pen with it. It’s perfect for digital planner and the overall user experience is solid! More like the iPhone, I do wish there was an on/off switch for sound.
I love my Ipad. Ive had it for months and I use it for everything! Routines, recepies, school work, reading, etc … I even use it to find my phone when I lose it. 
I drew a beautiful portrait for my husband and it was all thanks to this because I wouldn’t have been able to myself on paper. Has great life battery and I love that I receive my calls on here too. 12/10
I’ve been using it for a year now, and it’s been working great so far. I recommend it to all the college students (like me) who need to take notes during lectures. It’s also the perfect size for my handbag. I’m sure that it would be great for business women who have less space in their handbags. And if you buy it with a keyboard case it can function just like a MacBook. 
In conclusion I give it 5 stars because there is not a day of me not using the iPad and it has never failed me for speed, quality picture, and just being perfect for everyday use. And most of all, it’s affordable!!!!
Great piece of hardware. Vibrant display, simple to use, and good battery life.
The 9th Generation iPad is working great.  Didn't need any more storage that 64GB.  Later models don't have the button but I like the button.
It’s super fast and great quality. I’ve had it for a few months now and never had an issue. You’re able to get ios16 and up so it’s still a great iPad for 2022 and the years to come. The battery life is also really good. You can use the iPad all day without it dying. Watching movies or just YouTube videos are good quality as well. You can get up to 1080p
I like the my Apple 10.2-inch iPad. It is fast and the the battery lasts for several hours. I have yet to need to plug it into the charger before the end of the day. Though I'm still leaning some of the ways it works, I like the connectivity with my Apple watch and MacBook pro. One of the functions that's most helpful is using the microphone to add text rather than typing it in some applications.
I know the 9th Gen IPad isn’t full of the latest greatest in technology, and it APPEARS to be the same as the 8th Gen IPad, but…

It has a new front facing camera with Center Stage technology….a faster processor, and a few other updates including more memory.  And….they price matched Amazon so I got mine for $299.

I couldn’t justify the additional couple hundred bucks to go with the mini 6 or the iPad Air. And call me old, but I love the simplicity of the traditional “Home” button.

I think I kind of stole it @ $299…
I absolutely love my new IPad!! It’s the perfect size and I can put it in my purse and take it when I travel!
I was going to buy the same model for the same price from Amazon. As my luck would have it Amazon didn’t deliver. I had a flight to catch the next day back home from the United States so I cancelled the Amazon order and drove out to Best Buy and bought the same thing for the same price except this was BRAND NEW and Amazon was refurbished. Never have I ever been so grateful that a delivery didn’t occur. Thanks a million!
Bought for wife. Great value and easy setup . Well worth the money. Bought online with pickup. Got to store, they have a special section for online purchases. iPad was there and only took a few minutes and I was on my way
It has been a pleasure shopping with y’all the iPad is in great conditions and we have had no problems with it. We enjoy watching shows on it and playing games. It has been a great purchase thank you for your help! I would absolutely recommend buying this iPad it is AMAZING! The battery works really good last a good amount of time the display is great quality I would %100 recommend for others to buy this iPad.
bought it for my dad for christmas almost 2 years ago and it runs perfectly fine and it’s great. He uses for his entertainment like youtube and to help him with work related stuff. Good price and you get what you get for.
Is one of the greatest purchases I have done at Best Buy! I love my iPad so much! It’s so affordable and so convenient!! It’s easy to use and so fun!
As with all Apple products excellent iPad is lightweight. Long last battery. Great price at Best Buy.
So, I finally caved in and got myself the iPad 9th generation, and let me tell you, it's been a wild ride. At first, I was like, "Why did I buy this? Is it just a sleeker version of a cutting board?" Well, turns out, it's more than that – much more.

I've been using it for everything, from pretending I'm an artist with the Apple Pencil to mastering the art of multitasking by having two apps open at the same time (because who needs a single-focus life?). It's like having a personal assistant that doesn't judge me for binge-watching cat videos.

The best part? It serves the purpose. What purpose, you ask? Well, the purpose of making me look cooler than I actually am. Who knew a piece of tech could boost my social standing? Now, people think I'm the tech guru of the neighborhood.

In conclusion, the iPad 9th gen might have started as a mystery purchase, but now, it's the MVP of my daily shenanigans. If you're looking for a device that's not just a cutting board but can also make you feel like you've got your life together, this is the one for you. 5/5, would buy again (even if I still don't know what I got it for).
We have the 4, 7, and now- the Generation 9. This one loads programs much faster and the battery only requires charging every few days. The camera takes sharp photos. At $249.00, it was a great bargain factoring a Gen 10 was $200.00 more. A Speck cover for protection made the perfect companion for this iPad and incorporates a fold down magnetic corner that protects the lens. Updates download quickly and the Setup was a breeze. Best Buy has been our goto technology store for years without issue or complaint. For us, exceptional pricing and great service makes shopping at Best Buy… the Best Buy!
I love it so much I literally take it everywhere with me. The size is perfect and it stays charged way longer than my iPhone.
Absolutely love it!! I used the pick-up method and it was swift and easy. The iPad as a whole is one of the best purchases I’ve made by far!!! Best Buy also gives lots of 3-4 month free trials for things like Apple Music, Apple TV, and more. It also has AMAZING battery life. The only thing is it does as fast as it charges and that is very slow but, nothing unbearable. I definitely recommend.
The iPad was on sale, which is perfect for my financial budget. The iPad is lightweight and small enough to fit in a tote bag for university. It is compatible with the Apple Pencil or other Bluetooth pencils so I can write on the iPad itself. I can also type on the iPad by connecting a Bluetooth keyboard and the iPad acts as a monitor that is big enough for my eyes and small enough for my bag.
Super convenient for my 6yr old. Very durable, with a case of course. It has the right amount of storage so she can download all her games. The only con is the battery life isn’t what I thought it should be for it to be a new device.
I’ve been thinking about buying this item for so long! I got it on sale for $249, amazing product, so easy to use.
Very good for the price , fast , good images basically is good deal for the price
I love it. Works great, i had a laptop that was hacked needed something 1. With great security, which this IPad has 2.the size and weight can’t go wrong.3 The ease of accessibility.4 The only things that I didn’t like was that the app journal isn’t on iPad only on iPhone,5 The Note pad doesn’t convert the written text from pencil to text so and there is no option, 6 Note Pad isn’t that thourogh as other applications like word ect
The iPad is great and was easy to use. The color is nice and looks like it did in pictures. The shipping was very fast and it arrived in good condition as it was packed in a box and not a bubble bag. The space of the iPad is sufficient for me since I don’t need a lot of storage space for casual use. The price was a good deal and cheaper than other vendors.
I bought this iPad because of the size. I am an instructor and needed something handy for me to use while observing students. I have no issues with it. The battery life is also awesome it lasts a couple of days.
I’ve always wanted an iPad but couldn’t justifying buying one until I began working as an RBT working with kids. It’s helped with creating crafts, worksgeets, and so much more!! Battery lasts for days at a time! 
Also helps on road trips when my toddler needs a movie for entertainment!!
Excellent IPAD! I bought it for my daughter to use for school and best decision ever! She also is starting to use it for a podcast that she is creating!
Works good.        Had it for a week now 
Hasn’t given me problems
I’m very happy with my purchase.  Just what I needed for reading and streaming.
Worth the money! Highly recommend if you like apple
The iPad is a versatile and powerful device that has transformed the way we interact with technology. Its sleek design, vibrant display, and intuitive user interface make it a joy to use for everything from productivity tasks to entertainment. Whether you're sketching ideas with the Apple Pencil, multitasking with Split View, or immersing yourself in augmented reality experiences, the iPad offers endless possibilities. While it may not replace a traditional computer for all users, its portability and convenience make it a valuable addition to anyone's tech arsenal. Whether you're a student, artist, professional, or simply someone who loves to stay connected, the iPad delivers a seamless and immersive experience that's hard to beat.
I recently purchased an iPad from Best Buy, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. From its sleek design to its impressive performance, this iPad has become an indispensable tool in my day to day life.                                                   In terms of performance, this iPad is a powerhouse. The processor is lightning-fast, allowing for seamless multitasking and smooth operation of even the most demanding apps. Whether I'm running productivity tools, graphic-intensive games, or resource-heavy applications, the iPad handles everything with ease.
They quality of the pictures and videos of the ninth generation ipad is excellent. The prices really good only $245 - on sale. I checked the review between the 9th generation iPad and 10th Generation iPad and a ninth generation iPad is a much better value for your money. The screen is much bigger than my galaxy tablet.
Easy to use, very useful to me. This device is really good, has a perfect set up. If I can, I'll use iPad for long time.
Great iPad! Great price!………………………………………………………………….
For my 8 yr old hope it lasts awhile seems fine ordered cover off the jungle website
I love Apple products.  The I-Pad is an intuitive tool that can be used in the classroom, board room, and the living room! Whether you are a little kid playing a game or watching a funny video stream or a CEO or president of a company keeping copious notes or presenting on an important change, the I-Pad is the way!  Thank you Apple.  Thank you Best Buy.
I love that Apple and Best Buy have purchase options for people like me that don't have to have the newest and shiniest object as soon as it is available. My first iPad was a gift. Normally, I am an Android guy and in the past have had an Apple product, too. So, I know the quality of their products. When my old iPad started to get a little glitchy I thought it was time for an upgrade. My research led me to my current open box/remanufactured tablet. I'm very happy with my purchase to the point of adding a folio keyboard and stylus pen for extra options. All of this for less than $400 made me happy to be a returning customer.
I honestly love it. It’s a great beginning iPad for kids, my daughter loves her she gets to watch her favorite movies anywhere she goes. I also use it to take notes for school and it’s honestly my favorite thing to use when studying.
Im please with the ipad 9th generation, very easy to navigate anf fast with my internet. Now going to purchase a key board.
Bought this for my dad for christmas and he is in love with it, uses it every single day. He likes to play games, watch a lot of YouTube, and scroll through Facebook as he pleases on it! The greatest thing is that he already knows how to work an iPhone, so an iPad was definitely the best option for him because he already knew how to work it.
My iPad is amazing love it so much!!! Having it makes life so much easier for personal things and work!
My 7G iPad has issues so it was nice to get an upgrade. The battery on the iPad 9 recharges quickly. It is easy to use with the same basic layout as the 7 but much better & twice the memory
Good price for a slightly older model of iPad - don’t do tons of heavy duty stuff with it but a worthwhile purchase for me for streaming services and reading news and books - big plus that it integrates with my MacBook Pro and my iPhone- I’m happy with my purchase- it uses older 1st gen Apple Pencil, not current 2nd gen, fwiw
If there’s one thing I got right this year it’s the iPad. My partner was so happy when she unwrapped her brand new iPad. It was easy to install all of her apps from her phone & is the perfect space for her to doodle. It’s very light & functions wonderful. Recommend for all men who aren’t sure what to get their loved ones for Christmas!
The iPad is wonderful it works well I bought it for my toddler a couple months ago, that iPad survived so many falls down the stairs until today! The battery would last me almost a week
I have an 11 inch iPad Pro but this 10.2 puts out powerful sound and the thumb print security is highly accessible for me. I have owned several iPads from Best Buy and this model is obscenely cheap for similar stores.
Fast & reliable. Performs as intended and last days without charging. Easy for kids to use.
This is the perfect size for both my 5 year old son and for me!  We watch our favorite YouTubers and I get to catch up on Netflix shows when we travel.  It holds a good charge for most of the day! We never leave home without it!
I am truly loving my IPad, 9th generation and the price was best around!  And the ease in which I experienced making this purchase was bar non. I got it in just a couple days after placing the order and everything works and linked right up to my other apple products. Thank you, Best Buy!
It is an excellent iPad, with very good features. 

Advantages 

- It has very good graphics and colors.
- It has very good battery life.
- I love using it to take notes and study.  
- The camera takes excellent photos.

Conclusion: It's an Amazing iPad with a really great price. ¡I just love it!
I've been wanting one of these forever! I love the way it operate. I bought a really nice cover for it too. The only thing I don't care for is the ipad getting really warm if I be on it too long
Two thumbs up 10/10, iPad works fantastic for my fiancé  she loves it. I got it for her birthday and she’s been using it everyday since she’s gotten it last month!
Very nice weight, feels durable. Responsiveness is extremely fast and every app opens in a blink of an eye. Storage space is is small but with the 2tb cloud storage it’s not a concern. Beats any android tablet I’ve ever used.
I love this IPad. Easy to setup and use. It’s like using my iPhone with a bigger screen. I purchased the keyboard which allows me to use it as a mini computer.
Perfect for my son. The battery seemed to hold well at first but after a year it seems to be dying much quicker, 64g is not enojgh storage if you are using the messages and photo album. My son only plays Roblox so it seems to be ok for now but I would recommend purchasing the higher storage. Overall the tablet works well, he’s gotten good use out of it and everything worked as expected .
Best thing you can have specially when u r in college as u can make notes easily. Buying it from best buy was best choice as it is way more cheaper than any other website. Battery life is awesome and pencil’s battery is great. Just charge for 2 min and u r good to go for whole 2 hour lecture
For getting a 9th generation for an affordable price it's a overall really good purchase, and I would highly recommend it My niece loves it so much. She has been using it for the past couple weeks bringing it to school etc etc and she said so far so good she has no complaints. In her words " 10/10 would recommend"
Git this for my wife on Mother’s Day from Best Buy during a great sale. All the other stores had this same Ipad on sale but only Best Buy had it brand new, all the others were refurbished. Wife does not put it down. It’s her planner, her cookbook, her AI assistant, it multi tasks for her. Take your time and really find out and research how to use and what you can do with these IPads. You’ll be amazed. She makes AI art of our chihuahua and put it in clothing lol.
I love my new iPad, love the sceen size the speeb and long laster battery, so many options available on protective cases for this model.
Got this one for a great price.  Great to carry around.
Love my new ipad, everything works just fine! Would highly recommend for anyone who doesn’t usually shop online, I was indeed nervous.
Does the job got three on sale for like 250 can’t beat that at all very satisfied with the product my kids love them way more than the kindle fires good battery life comes with chargers. Best Buy had fast shipping as well will purchase from again
Affordable iPad and offers plenty of power. Great gift especially for Mom for video calls. This 9th-gen iPad is by far the best choice compared to other brand of tablets.
The iPad 9th gen is a very good device. All the apps open quickly. The  screen is pretty good. The only thing is the charging takes awhile. Overall, I definitely recommend it especially when it's on sale for $199
It has been a year since I purchased my iPad 10.2 inch and let me tell you it has been an excellent investment for my studies. This iPad helped me with my math classes, especially Statistics and Business Calculus. I passed my classes and I also got accepted to UCSD! The employee who helped me was outstanding as well, he told me enough info to purchase this bad boy.
iPad 9th generation is good. As I am using .storage data is more . U can easily take it with ur self .
This iPad is very easy to use, a great size, and runs fantastic. I have had no issues so far. I use it for playing games, college assignments, and just for watching TV in bed. With my purchase, I got Apple TV and a few other perks for free. Overall, it is worth the price, as the quality and perks are above and beyond.
great ipad for the price, and movies downloaded for a trip and worked perfect, was entertained for the whole trip
The ordering process was easy to complete. Shipping was done quickly. The iPad arrived with no issues. I love using it. Pictures are clear. Sound is great. It works well for me.
Good battery life, easy to set up and log in, works fast, and has a decent camera. I mainly use it to take notes which does the job well. Would highly recommend!
I decided to buy this ipad for my daughter, she will be leaving for college in the fall. This is such a great ipad she can use it in class just as she would use a computer, it's the perfect size not too small but big enough to give a desktop feel. Thiaboad is compatible with all her school software. In the picture below my daughter paired her IPAD with a clip in laptop case it's Perfect because it gives her a two in one feel
Great product for new and experienced users good battery life
Tablet is wonderful, the camera is supprisingly good (no flash). Bluetooth conectivity is good untill you connect more then 2 things. Easy to use and carry. I got a case with a keyboard in it online and its perfect to use instead of a laptop, honestly this is a better option if youre looking for a laptop for work as you can do more on it and it has better screen, also it can be unpluged for longer periods of times then laptops in the sams price range. (: (has a headphone jack)
Great product.  Large screen, good battery, good amount of memory.
Very good version for kids they can do anything like study , games, messages, face time,fast, the battery lasts long
My old iPad finally broke so I decided to upgrade and boy do I love it!! I use it everyday more than my phone. Works amazingly and has great features. Would recommend if you’re thinking about it. Battery life is perfect!
My granddaughter loves her new iPad said it’s the best birthday present ever and works great with her iPhone and was a breeze to set up!
I got this iPad for my daughter and she loves it! I love that you can create children’s profiles to require permission to purchase any apps or make it your own! Best Buy made it super affordable with there price match option of course which is always great especially when you have a big family and need to save as much as possible!
I was looking for a last minute Christmas gift. Best Buy always has what I’m looking for. The IPAD is just what I wanted. Great price great service. Apple and Best Buy equal 100 all the time
Haven’t used it that long but my wife has used iPads for the past 10:years and loves them. So much easier than carrying a laptop when traveling. Works great and so portable and lightweight.
The product is amazing, got it for my wife as a birthday present. She loves it and works perfectly and nice quality good battery life
I love my iPad. I didn't need the newest model and was very happy to find this on black Friday for an absolute steal. I primarily use it for art and Photoshop so i got an Apple pencil to go with it.
It’s an amazing product. The battery lasts for about two days without charging it. The camera is good too and it has a good amount of storage. I would recommend getting this for your kids.
The product is good. My son loves it. I bought Apple iPad for him. Also the store associate that helped me was knowledgeable and friendly. Although that store is always busy the staff is super nice and the products are affordable. Best Buy always have deals or special offer so I love to get all my electronic gears from them and more.
This is exactly what I was looking for in a tablet. I use it mostly for reading books and internet browsing. I have not had any problems with memory or battery life. The store had my product ready for pick up within the hour! This was super easy to set with my iPhone also.
My favorite apple product ive bought!!
Battery lasts a while
